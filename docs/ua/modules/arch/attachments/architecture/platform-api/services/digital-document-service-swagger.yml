      summary: Upload MultiPart document
      description: |-
        ### Endpoint purpose:
         This endpoint allows to upload a document as part of a specified process instance. It accepts a multi-part file and an optional file name. The uploaded document's metadata is returned upon successful storage.
        ### Validation:
         The file size should not exceed the system limit; otherwise, a _413 Payload Too Large_ status code is returned. For batch file uploads, the total file size should not exceed the expected limit. Media type validation accepts the following formats: PDF, PNG, JPG/JPEG, CSV, ASICs, P7S. If a different format is used, a _422 Unprocessable Entity_ status code is returned.
