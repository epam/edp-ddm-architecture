        ### Endpoint purpose
        The purpose of the endpoint is to create authorizations for list of roles to be able to create [process instances](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.16/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-concepts/#process-instances). It takes a list of group names as input and creates authorizations for those groups and returns the count of created authorizations.
        
        Created authorizations are [Camunda Process-Instance authorizations](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.16/webapps/admin/authorization-management/) with permissions `CREATE` and resource id `'*'`

        The purpose of the endpoint is to delete all created authorizations created by [/extended/authorizations/process-instance/create](#Extended%20authorizations/createProcessInstanceAuthorizations) and [/extended/authorizations/process-definition/create](#Extended%20authorizations/createProcessDefinitionAuthorizations) at once.
        
        It returns the count of deleted authorizations.
        
        __*WARNING:*__ If there are any authorizations that match the endpoint search criteria and were created _manually_ or with a _different endpoint_, they will be __deleted__ as well. This applies to process definitions with permissions `READ, CREATE_INSTANCE` and to process instances with `CREATE` permission and resource ID `'*'`.
