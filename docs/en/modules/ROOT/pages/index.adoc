== About the Platform

*_The Platform for state registries_* is an information system designed to _deliver government services in a digital format efficiently_. It enables the rapid creation, modeling, deployment, and maintenance of electronic state registries, striking an optimal balance between data security requirements, deployment speed, registry ownership costs, and data exchange with other registries.

== Problem statement

=== Current condition of registries

Across the globe, many countries are grappling with a need for uniformity in how their public state registers are created and managed. This inconsistency stymies the practical application of crucial principles of digital development policy, such as reusability, technology neutrality, data portability, interoperability, security, and confidentiality. Consequently, this results in increased complexity in delivering administrative services while also acting as a roadblock to their transition to online platforms.

In the case of Ukraine, over 450 state registries exist, each with distinct ownership. Individual teams are responsible for creating and maintaining each registry, and they each operate on their dedicated infrastructure, whether physical hardware or a cloud-based solution.

The current situation can be characterized as both *_decentralized_* and *_unregulated_*:

* *_Decentralized_* refers to separate infrastructures for data storage maintained by different owners. This distinction is crucial regarding data collection, storage, and usage accountability.

* *_Unregulated_* signifies the absence of guarantees that the registries interact correctly. This interaction should occur over secure connections, comply with data retention policies, and align with software reuse and resource optimization principles.

=== The concept of a platform for deploying registries and solving the problem

Given the current situation and potential risks associated with defining responsibility for data protection, the Platform advocates a shift towards a *_decentralized_* but *_regulated_* approach.

This approach guarantees the preservation of data owner identification, establishing *_clear data responsibility_*. Simultaneously, it lays the groundwork for further Platform enhancements, positioning registries as a complex of hardware and software tools. These tools are designed to implement the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine's requirements.
