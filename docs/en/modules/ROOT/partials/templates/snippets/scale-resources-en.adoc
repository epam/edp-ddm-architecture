// VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL RESOURCES SCALING
Each registry has specific tasks, workflow logic, and configurations, leading to certain services involved in performing these tasks to a greater or lesser extent.

Depending on the load on a particular registry, which directly depends on the number of requests from active users, the registry's services require a certain amount of resources. They can be deployed in one or more instances.

[TIP]
====
For instance, when serving 1,500 active users over 1 hour, a hypothetical registry should have approximately the following configuration:

Depending on the needs of your registry, you can modify configurations for certain services. Precisely, you can:

Scale resources vertically ::
This operation can be done in two ways:

* (_Primary method_) In the *Control Plane* administrative panel, in the section for managing resources for services.
+
TIP: You can learn more about this on the xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-registry-resources.adoc[] page.

* (_Alternative method_) In the *OpenShift* console:
+
NOTE: This approach allows you to add resources to specific services quickly, but over time, the settings will revert to those specified in the _Helm_ chart.

** Select the project with your registry > *Workloads* > *Deployments* > Open the service settings > *YAML*.

** In the `spec.containers.resources` section, you can set the required configuration parameters for *CPU* and *memory*.
** In the `spec.containers.resources.env` section, you can define environment variables for your applications, such as `JAVA_OPTS`, Ceph variables, etc.

Scale resources horizontally ::
Horizontal scaling can be done by increasing the number of replicas of certain services.

* Currently, you can scale horizontally like this:
+
NOTE: This approach allows you to add the number of replicas for desired services quickly, but over time, the settings will revert to those specified in the _Helm_ chart.

** Select the project with your registry > *Workloads* > *Deployments* > Open the service settings > *YAML*.

** In the `spec.replicas` section, you can set the required number of replicas for the selected service.

NOTE: Setting up _horizontal scaling_ automatically (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) will be possible in the xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-registry-resources.adoc[Managing registry resources] section of the *Control Plane* administrative panel in upcoming releases, starting with `1.9.7`.
