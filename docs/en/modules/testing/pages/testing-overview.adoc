The Quality attributes testing section provides a comprehensive guide to the various testing approaches necessary to ensure the highest quality of the Platform.
This section comprises three main pages, each dedicated to a specific type of testing:

Functional testing::
This page focuses on testing functionalities within the Platform to ensure they work as intended. The primary goal of functional testing is to ensure that the software behaves correctly according to the defined specifications and user expectations. It helps identify defects and discrepancies in the software's behavior, ensuring it delivers the intended value to users.

Performance testing::
This page assesses the Platform's performance, reliability, and scalability under various workload conditions.
It involves identifying bottlenecks and issues that need to be resolved to optimize the user experience
and ensure that the Platform and registries can manage the anticipated volume of users or transactions.

Security testing::
Security testing is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and potential threats within the Platform.
It involves testing the system's ability to protect data, withstand attacks,
and ensure the Platform's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
