[#bp-modeling]
=== Modeling the business process

[TIP]
====

At the business process modeling stage, you need to create and save the corresponding BPMN diagram.

Download the _link:{attachmentsdir}/study-project/task-1/bp-schema/add-lab-test.bpmn[add-lab-test.bpmn]_ file with a sample business process schema to use as an example.
====

==== Business process modeling stages

For this task, you need to create a business process consisting of *six stages*:

. xref:#create-pool-bp[Create a pool for the business process].

. xref:#create-start-event[Create a start event].

. xref:#create-task-add-lab-data[Create a user task to add data].

. xref:#create-task-view-lab-data[Create a user task to view data].

. xref:#create-service-task-bp-result[Create a service task with the business process result].

. xref:#create-end-event[Create an end event].

CAUTION: After completing all the steps, be sure to save the business process schema you modeled to the appropriate folder with the registry regulations (for details, see xref:#save-bp-schema[Saving the business process schema]).

[#create-pool-bp]
==== Creating a pool for the business process

To *model a pool for your business process*, perform the following steps:

. Open the *Camunda Modeler* app and create a new BPMN diagram. To do this, open the menu in the upper left corner and click *File* > *New File* > *BPMN Diagram*.

. In the toolbar on the left, find the *Create pool/Participant* item and drag it to the modeling panel. Fill out the following fields:
+

* *Name*: Enter the task's name—for example, `Add lab data`.

* *Process Id*: Enter the process ID—for example, `add-lab-test`.

* *Process Name*: Enter the process name—for example, `Add lab data`.
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-1-bp.png[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to create a pool for each business process. This is necessary to set the following parameters:

* A unique `Process Id` to use the business process in the system and a `Process Name` to display the name of the process in the user portal.

* The `Executable` checkbox indicates business processes that should be deployed in the registry. The default value is `true`.
====

[#create-start-event]
==== Creating a start event

To *create a start event*, perform the following steps:

. In the toolbar on the left, find the *CreateStartEvent* item (a circle) and drag it to the modeling panel.

. In the properties panel on the right, fill out the following parameters:

* *Name*: Enter `start`.

* *Initiator*: Enter `initiator`. This variable will contain information about the user who started the business process.
+
[TIP]
====

For details on the "initiator" variable, see  xref:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/modeling-facilitation/modelling-with-juel-functions.adoc[].
====
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-2-bp.png[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====

Every business process must start with a *`StartEvent`* and end with an *`EndEvent`*.
====

[#create-task-add-lab-data]
==== Creating a user task to add data

To *create a user task to add data*, perform the following steps:

. Select the circle with the start event from the xref:#create-start-event[previous stage] and add a new user task by clicking the *Append Task* icon.

. Set the task type by clicking the wrench icon and selecting *User Task* from the menu.

. In the properties panel on the right, enter the task's name into the *Name* field: `Add lab data`.

. In the properties panel on the right, configure the following parameters:

.. Click *`Open Catalog`*, select the *User Form* template, and click *`Apply`*.

.. Fill out the following fields:

* *Id*: Enter `addLabForm`.

* *Name*: Enter the task's name—for example, `Add lab data`.

* *Form key*: Enter `add-lab-bp-add-lab-test`.

* *Assignee*: Enter `${initiator}`.

image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-3-bp.png[]

[#create-task-view-lab-data]
==== Creating a user task to view data

To *create a user task to view data*, perform the following steps:

. Select the rectangle with the user task from the xref:#create-task-add-lab-data[previous stage] and add a new user task by clicking the *Append Task* icon.

. In the properties panel on the right, enter the task's name into the *Name* field: `View lab data`.

. Set the task type by clicking the wrench icon and selecting *User Task* from the menu.

. In the properties panel on the right, configure the following parameters:
+
--

.. Click *`Open Catalog`*, select the *User Form* template, and click *`Apply`*.

.. Fill out the following fields:

* *Name*: Enter `View lab data`.
+
[TIP]
====

The task's *Name* field is used to display the task's name in the business process and does not affect the business logic in any way.
====

* *Form key*: Enter `add-lab-bp-view-lab-test`.
+
[TIP]
====

The *Form key* field defines the unique ID of the form. It is set when creating a form through the Administrative portal. The process of creating a form and assigning an ID is covered xref:#forms-modeling[further in this topic].
====

* *Assignee*: Enter `${initiator}`.
+
[TIP]
====

The `Assignee` field indicates which user will perform the task. Because the system supports transferring the business process execution between users, it is necessary to indicate the assignee.

In our example, it's the `initiator` -- the user who initiated the execution of this business process.
====

* *Form data pre-population*: Enter the `${submission("addLabForm").formData}` variable.

* *Status*: Enter `Lab data is displayed`.
--
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-5-bp.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====

This service task sets the business process execution status, displayed in the user portal with the text you specified.

This helps users better understand what happens during the business process execution.
====

[#create-end-event]
==== Creating an end event

To *model the end event to finish the business process*, perform the following steps:

. Select the rectangle with the `Set BP result` service task from the xref:#create-service-task-bp-result[previous stage] and add an end event by clicking the *Append EndEvent* icon.

. In the properties panel on the right, enter the name into the *Name* field: `end`.

image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-6-bp.png[]

[#save-bp-schema]
==== Saving the business process schema

After you finish modeling your business process, save the diagram to the _add-lab-test.bpmn_ file in the project's _bpmn_ regulations folder in the Gerrit repository. To do this, select *File* > *Save File As* from the menu in the upper-left corner, and specify the appropriate name and path for your diagram.

[#forms-modeling]
=== Modeling forms

[TIP]
====

During the form modeling stage, you need to create and connect JSON forms to the business process tasks you modeled previously.

The forms are connected to business processes using the service name.

Use the _link:{attachmentsdir}/study-project/task-1/bp-forms/add-lab-bp-add-lab-test.json[add-lab-bp-add-lab-test.json]_ and _link:{attachmentsdir}/study-project/task-1/bp-forms/add-lab-bp-view-lab-test.json[add-lab-bp-view-lab-test.json]_ sample files with form examples.
====

==== Prerequisites

The UI forms used in business processes are modeled in the *Administrative portal* web app.

[TIP]
====

You can get a link to the Administrative portal in the *OpenShift* web console. To do this, go to *Networking* > *Routes*, select the appropriate project, search for `admin-portal`, and copy the link from the *Location* column.

image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-15-forms.png[]
====

[NOTE]
====
For details on modeling UI forms, see xref:registry-develop:bp-modeling/forms/registry-admin-modelling-forms.adoc[].
====

[#form-types]
==== Form types

For this task, you need to create *two types* of forms to configure interactions with the business process:

* xref:form-insert-data[data entry form]

* xref:form-view-data[data view form]

[#form-insert-data]
==== Creating a data entry form

[WARNING]
====
We recommend using the link:https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/[Google Chrome] browser for this task.
====

First, you need to *create the form where users can enter data*. Perform the following steps:

. Sign in to the *Administrative portal*.
+
image::registry-develop:bp-modeling/forms/admin-portal-form-modeling-step-1.png[]

. By default, the portal opens the master version of the regulations, displaying the forms that were already deployed. At this point, it will be empty.
+
In the master version, forms are available in read-only mode and cannot be edited.
+
To add and edit forms, you need to create a version candidate by selecting the *`Create new request`* item from the menu in the upper left corner.
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-16-forms.png[]

. In the *Create new request* window, fill out the following fields:

* *Version name*: Enter `task-registry-update`.
* *Version description*: Enter `Creating forms for task 1`.
+
Click the *`Create`* button.
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-17-forms.png[]
+
After you create a request, the portal automatically redirects you to the version candidate, where you can add and edit forms.

. Go to the *UI forms* section. To create a new form for the business process, click the *`Create new form`* button.
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-18-forms.png[]

. In the dialog window, fill out the following fields:
+
--

* *Form's business name*: Enter the name of the xref:#create-task-add-lab-data[appropriate user task] -- `Add lab data`.

* *Form's service name*: Enter `add-lab-bp-add-lab-test`.
--
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-19-forms.png[]

. Go to the *Build* tab.
+
[NOTE]
====
We recommend using the components from the *Updated* section.
====
+
From the panel on the left, drag the *Text Field* component onto the modeling canvas and configure the following parameters:
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-20-forms.png[]

* In the *Display* tab > *Label* field, enter `Laboratory name`:
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-7-forms.png[]

* In the *API* tab > *Property Name* field, enter `name`.

* Click *`Save`* to save your changes.
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-8-forms.png[]

. From the panel on the left, drag the *Text Field* component onto the modeling canvas and configure the following parameters:

* In the *Display* tab > *Label* field, enter `EDRPOU or RNOKPP code`:
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-9-forms.png[]

* In the *API* tab > *Property name* field, enter `edrpou`.
* Click *`Save`* to save your changes.

. Save your form by clicking the *`Create form`* button in the upper right corner:
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-11-forms.png[]

[#form-view-data]
==== Creating a form to view data

After you create a data entry form, *create another form to view data*.

You can copy the xref:#form-insert-data[form you modeled previously] by clicking the copy icon or create a new form by clicking the *`Create new form`* button in the upper right corner.

image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-12-forms.png[]

*Configure the form's parameters*:

* *Form's business name*: Enter the name of the xref:#create-task-view-lab-data[appropriate user task] -- `View lab data`.

* *Form's service name*: Enter `add-lab-bp-view-lab-test`.

* For both *Laboratory name* and *EDRPOU or RNOKPP code* components, configure the following:

** In the *Display* tab, select the *Disabled* checkbox.

** Click *`Save`* to save your changes.
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-13-forms.png[]

==== Saving the business process forms

. Save your form by clicking the *`Create form`* button in the upper right corner.

. Download your forms by clicking the download icon.
+
image:registry-develop:study-project/task-1/task-1-14-forms.png[]
+
. Copy them to the _forms_ regulations folder of your project in the local Gerrit repository.

[#bp-access]
=== Modeling business process access

[TIP]
====
At this stage, you need to grant access to the business process from the officer portal.

Access parameters are configured via the _link:{attachmentsdir}/study-project/task-1/bp-access/officer.yml[officer.yml]_ file.
====

Create the _officer.yml_ file and specify the following parameters:

[source,yaml]
----
authorization:
  realm: 'officer'
  process_definitions:
    - process_definition_id: 'add-lab-test'
      process_name: 'Creating a laboratory'
      process_description: 'Laboratory creation regulations'
      roles:
        - officer
----

Save the _officer.yml_ file to the _bp-auth_ regulations folder of your project in the local Gerrit repository.

[IMPORTANT]
====

If you don't specify this configuration, your business process will be deployed in the regulations but will not appear in the user portal.

* The _bp-auth/officer.yml_ file contains the business processes available in the officer portal.

* The _bp-auth/citizen.yml_ file contains the business processes available in the citizen portal.

The `roles` parameter is a list of roles for which the business process will be visible in the user portal. Roles can be assigned to the user through the *Keycloak* service in the corresponding realm. For details on roles and access control, see xref:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/access/roles-rbac-bp-modelling.adoc[].
====

=== Setting up mandatory configurations

The _camunda-global-system-vars.yml_ file cannot be empty. Add the following line to it:

----
supportEmail: help@support.com
----

== Uploading the regulations files to a remote Gerrit repository

To successfully deploy the business process with forms and apply the correct access settings in the target environment, the registry regulations administrator/developer must upload the locally stored registry regulations files to the remote Gerrit code repository.

To do this, perform the steps described in the following topic: xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/regulations-deploy/registry-admin-deploy-regulation.adoc[].
