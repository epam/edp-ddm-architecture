== General overview

This page demonstrates an example of implementing and launching a business process that is automatically activated according to a schedule using the *Timer* BPMN element. The process initiates itself at a specified time and performs tasks according to a defined sequence.

A reference business process has been created to help registry developers and modelers to better understand and effectively use timers.

=====
include::partial$snippets/demo-reg-reference-examples-en.adoc[]

An example of a BPMN process diagram will be available in the demo-registry's regulations by searching for the keywords -- *_automatic-external-system-data-saving_*. The names of the forms can be found inside the corresponding User Tasks of the business process in the *`Form key`* field.

=== Brief overview of process components and their purpose

. *Start Event with the timer* -- initiates the business process at a set time, daily from Monday to Friday at 8:00.

. *Script*—retrieves data from an external system and creates an object for further storage.

. *Data signing with a system key* -- ensures that the data received from the external system is authentic and intact.

. *Entity creation in the database* -- stores the received data in the database.

. *Setting the business process status* -- indicates the successful completion of the business process.

. *End Event* -- marks the end of the business process.

=== Modeling

. Log in to the *Administrative portal*.
. Open the *Process models* section.

. Create a new business process. Enter business and service name for this process. Go to the *Builder* tab.

. Model a pool for the business process.
+

. Create a *Start event* starting event and perform the following settings:

.. Enter the task name, for example, `Start`.

.. In the *Timer* section, set the schedule for starting and executing the business process.

.. In the *Type* field (`Timer Definition Type`), specify the timer type - *Cycle*.
+
[TIP]
====
The *Cycle* option allows you to configure recurring processes or events based on a specific time interval. A cyclic timer can be set at the level of a start event, intermediate event, or boundary event associated with a task performer.

For more details on timer types, refer to
xref:bp-modeling/bp/bpmn/events/timer-event.adoc[].
====

.. In the *Value* field, specify the schedule in a specific format for process execution. For example, *`0 8 * * MON-FRI`*.
+
[TIP]
====
You can configure a cyclic timer using the standard *`ISO 8601`* format for repeat intervals or a `*cron*` expression.

Examples of values for the ISO 8601 format: ::

* `R5/PT10S` -- every 10 seconds, up to 5 times.
* `R/P1D` -- daily, indefinitely.

Examples of values for the cron format: ::

* `0 8 * * MON-FRI`:
+
----
0: minutes (exactly at 0 minutes)
8: hours (8:00 in the morning)
*: day of the month (any day of the month)
*: month (any month)
MON-FRI: day of the week (Monday - Friday)
----

Thus, the above `cron` expression means that the process will be triggered every day from Monday to Friday at 8:00 in the morning.

* `0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI`:

This `cron` expression means that the process will be triggered every hour from 9 to 17 UTC time from Monday to Friday.
====

.. Specify the process initiator as *`initiator`*.
+
[TIP]
====
[%collapsible]
.Що таке ініціатор?
.What is an initiator?
=====

The phrase "*`Start initiator = initiator`*" indicates that the value of the initiator (i.e., the person or system that initiated the process) will be set as the initiator.

In the context of business processes, the initiator is the person who starts the process or is responsible for its initiation. Typically, the initiator is a user who triggers an action or a system that automatically initiates the process.

In this case, the term `initiator` can be used to identify the person or system that initiated the process in subsequent stages of the business process or for access control to resources.

. Create a script task and use the script to retrieve and process data. To do this, open the visual code editor (_for more information about the code editor, refer to
xref:registry-admin/admin-portal/registry-modeling/process-models/components/edit-groovy-scripts.adoc[]_). +
+
In our example, we retrieve data from another system.

._Script for data retrieval and processing_
[%collapsible]
====
[source,groovy]
----
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

SimpleDateFormat date = new SimpleDateFormat("dd_MM_yyyy")
String url = 'https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2601438.jpg'
String fileName = 'file_'.concat(date.format(new Date())).concat('.jpeg')
def documentMetadata = save_digital_document_from_url(url, fileName)

def payload = [:]
def listFileObj = []
payload.name = fileName
def fileObj = [:]
fileObj.id = documentMetadata.id
fileObj.checksum = documentMetadata.checksum
listFileObj << fileObj

payload.image = listFileObj
set_variable('payload', S(payload, 'application/json'))
----

The script retrieves data from an external system, creates a *`payload`* object with the obtained data, and stores it as a process variable for further use in subsequent stages of the business process, namely:

. Imports the `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` and `java.util.Date` classes for working with dates:
+
[source,groovy]
----
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;
----

. Creates a new `SimpleDateFormat` object with the format "`dd_MM_yyyy`" for date formatting:
+
[source,groovy]
----
SimpleDateFormat date = new SimpleDateFormat("dd_MM_yyyy");
----

. Defines the image URL for downloading:

+
[source,groovy]
----
String url = 'https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2601438.jpg';
----

. Generates a file name based on the current date, adding the prefix '`file_`' and the extension _.jpeg_:
+
[source,groovy]
----
String fileName = 'file_'.concat(date.format(new Date())).concat('.jpeg');
----

. Calls the function *`save_digital_document_from_url(url, fileName)`* to save the digital document (image) with the specified URL and file name:
+
[source,groovy]
----
def documentMetadata = save_digital_document_from_url(url, fileName);
----

. Creates an empty payload dictionary and a list `listFileObj` for constructing the JSON data structure:
+
[source,groovy]
----
def payload = [:];
def listFileObj = [];
----

. Assigns the generated file name to the name field of the *`payload`* dictionary:
+
[source,groovy]
----
payload.name = fileName;
----

. Creates a new empty dictionary `fileObj`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
def fileObj = [:];
----

. Assigns the *`id`* and *`checksum`* from the document metadata to the respective fields of the fileObj dictionary:
+
[source,groovy]
----
fileObj.id = documentMetadata.id;
fileObj.checksum = documentMetadata.checksum;
----

. Adds `fileObj` to the list `listFileObj`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
listFileObj << fileObj;
----

. Assigns the list `listFileObj` to the image field of the `payload` dictionary:
+
[source,groovy]
----
payload.image = listFileObj;
----

. Sets the variable '`payload`' with the value of the payload dictionary converted to a JSON string for use in subsequent steps of the business process.
+
[source,groovy]
----
set_variable('payload', S(payload, 'application/json'));
----
====

. Model a Service Task for data signing with a system key.

.. Use the delegate *System signature by DSO service* from the template catalog for applying the system signature.

.. Pass the input data as the variable `${payload}` in the corresponding field.

.. Pass the user token. You can do this using the JUEL function *`system_user()`* and the *`accessToken`* method. For example, `${system_user().accessToken`}. It can be further used in integration connectors for integration on behalf of the user.
+
You can also use the process initiator's token. For example, `${initiator().accessToken}`.
+
TIP: For more details, refer to
xref:bp-modeling/bp/modeling-facilitation/modelling-with-juel-functions.adoc[].

. Save the response in a variable. For example, *`system_signature_key`*.
+
image:best-practices/bp-timer-launch/bp-timer-launch-5.png[]

. Save data to the database. Create a new record in the database, storing the value of the *`entityLocation`* object in the respective column.

.. Use the *Create entity in data factory* delegate to create an entity in the database.
+
[TIP]
====
Alternatively, you can use the general integration connector *Connect to data factory*. For more information about integration extensions for business processes, refer to
xref:bp-modeling/bp/element-templates/service-task-templates/connect-to-data-factory.adoc[].
====

.. Specify the resource/API endpoint. For example, *`test-entity`*, which corresponds to the table name you defined when creating the data model registry -- *`test_entity`*.

.. Pass the input data as the *`${payload}`* variable in the corresponding field.

.. Pass the user token. You can do this using the JUEL function *`system_user()`* and the *`accessToken`* method. For example, *`${system_user().accessToken}`*.

.. Specify the *`X-Digital-Signature source`* -- the source of the system signature. For example, *`${system_signature_key}`*.

.. Specify the *`X-Digital-Signature-Derived source`* -- the Ceph document key that contains information about the signed data. For example, *`${system_signature_key}`*.

.. Save the response to a result variable, for example, `response`.

+
image:best-practices/bp-timer-launch/bp-timer-launch-6.png[]

. Set the status of the business process to reflect a successful completion of the business process. To do this, create a Service Task and apply the *Define business process status* delegate.

. Finish the process using the *End Event*.

. Apply the made changes to the master branch to publish the process in the schedule.

== Use within the user portal

The business process modeled and published by the schedule becomes accessible in the *Officer Portal*.

This process can be found in the *Available services* > *Reference business processes* section. It will be launched and executed according to the established schedule in a *Timer* event.

[TIP]
====
The Officer portal is available via the pattern link:

----
https://officer-portal-<registry-name>-main.<dns-wildcard>
----

where `<registry-name>` is the name for your registry and `<dns-wildcard>` designates the domain and subdomain names for the cluster instance.

For example, for the `demo-registry`, deployed on the `example.com` Platform instance, the route to the *Officer Portal* service is:

https://officer-portal-demo-registry-main.example.com

//https://officer-portal-{{{registry-name}}}-main.{{{dns-wildcard}}}
