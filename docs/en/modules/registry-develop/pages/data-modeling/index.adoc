*_Data modelers_* play a pivotal role in shaping and managing the data structure of the registry. They design logical and physical models, leveraging tools like _Liquibase_ and the _Administrative Portal_. These experts are well-versed in working with tags and modeling scenarios using the declarative approach to build data structures. Additionally, they prepare and load initial data into the registry. The section on analytical reporting delves into creating and utilizing reports within the registry.
