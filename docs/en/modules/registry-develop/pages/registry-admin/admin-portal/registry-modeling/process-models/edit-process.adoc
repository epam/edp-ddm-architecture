The Regulations administrator portal allows for editing, modifying, and developing existing business processes. If the modeler has made an error in the name, wants to change an element of the process diagram, or modify the XML code, they can enter the _editing mode_ and make the necessary changes.

NOTE: It is not possible to edit the internal technical name. Upon initial save, the technical name is stored in the repository as a unique identifier for the process within the registry instance and cannot be changed.

Edit an existing business process in a few simple steps:

. In the Regulations administrator portal, open the [.underline]#Process Models# section.

. Modify any component of the business process (business name, code, or BPMN element in the modeler).

. Click the [.underline]#Save changes# button to save the entered information.

[CAUTION]
====
Editing the components of the business process applies only to your change candidate version. To create a new change candidate version, refer to the page xref:registry-admin/admin-portal/version-control/create-new-change-request.adoc[].

You can review changes and their status in the [.underline]#Latest changes# section (_see more details at xref:registry-admin/admin-portal/version-control/overview-new-change-request.adoc#review-changes-candidate[Viewing latest changes]_).

If you have finished editing and want to publish the changes to the Gerrit repository, you need to apply the changes to the master version (_see more details at xref:registry-admin/admin-portal/version-control/overview-new-change-request.adoc#push-changes-master[Applying Changes to the Master Version page]_).
