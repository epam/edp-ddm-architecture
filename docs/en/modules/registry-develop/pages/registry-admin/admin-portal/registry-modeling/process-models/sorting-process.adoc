Utilize the functionality of sorting business processes. This allows you to arrange available process models in ascending `↑` or descending `↓` order, improve user experience, and explore the history of creation and modification of processes.

Apply the desired sorting type to the following columns: ::

* *Process name*
* *Technical name*
* *Created*
* *Last edited*

====
The sorting mechanism is the same for both business processes and UI forms.
