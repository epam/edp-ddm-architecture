The UI-form editing page is accessed by clicking on a form name, or `edit form` icon (&#128393;). The functionality of the page is provided on the following tabs:

[#general]
== General

Fields for entering UI-form business-name and service name are available on this tab. Business-name can be edited without any restrictions, while the service name is entered once on form creation, and can't be changed.

[#code]
== Code

This tab displays UI-form code, which can be copied and edited. If the form is being created in the xref:#builder[], the code will be updated automatically, and vice versa.

TIP: You can find more details on the functionality on the following page: xref:registry-admin/admin-portal/registry-modeling/ui-forms/json-code-view-edit.adoc[].

[#builder]
== Builder

This tab allows UI-form developers to create forms using in-built UI-components. The components can be found in the left menu, where they can be dragged from onto the work zone to create the corresponding fields of the UI-form. The search field on top of the menu allows the user to search for the required element by name or part of the name.

== Preview

Here the developer can check the way their UI-form looks in the service provider or service recipient portals. The tab emulates part of the form's operation, so that all its elements can be previewed.

== Request

This tab displays the form's _Data Factory_ API request code. This code can be copied, but it only can be edited indirectly by making certain changes in the xref:#builder[] or xref:#code[] tabs.
