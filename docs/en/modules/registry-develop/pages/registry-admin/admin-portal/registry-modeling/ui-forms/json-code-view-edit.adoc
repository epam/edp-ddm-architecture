The platform provides the ability to view and edit the JSON representation of a form on the *Code* tab.

This functionality allows for quick and easy changes to the form data without using the modeling builder.

CAUTION: Editing the components of a registry regulation is only possible within change candidate versions. The master version only allows viewing.

. Go to the section for managing UI forms.

. Open any form.

** `Form with this system name already exists`.

* Validation rules are violated. In this case, the user will see the validation message in the top right corner:

** `Check the format of required fields`.

* For the business name of the UI form:

** Validation rules are violated. In this case, the user will see the validation message in the top right corner:

** `Check the format of required fields`.
