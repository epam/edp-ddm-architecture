= Registry regulations modeling

The *_Registry regulations modeling_* section provides essential tools and methods for effective registry development and management. It begins with setting the _global parameters_ and transitioning into the configuration of _business process models_. Further, it delves into the design of _user interface forms_, facilitating data interaction. Integral to this process are _tables_â€”fundamental structures storing registry data. For those seeking precision, modeling the structure through an _XML code editor_ provides an advanced approach. Additionally, this section encompasses the management of _analytical reporting templates_, ensuring comprehensive data representation.
