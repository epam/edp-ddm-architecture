Utilize the functionality of business process copying. This allows for easier and faster creation of process diagrams. There is no need to model processes from scratchâ€”simply select a similar diagram that has been previously modeled and copy it.

Open the [.underline]#Process models# section and click on the copying icon next to the desired business process.

As a result, a _complete copy_ of the selected process (duplicate) is created, meaning that the entire code is copied.

[NOTE]
====
* The default business name of the process is created with the prefix *`Copy_`*.
* The default technical name of the process is *`new-bp`*.
