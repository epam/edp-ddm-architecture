Regulation developers have the ability to create duplicates of UI forms, which involves reproducing all their components, including JSON code and modeling components. Each copy is given the prefix `_COPY_` in its name. This feature is especially useful when developing a series of similar forms or when using an existing form as a template.

Follow these steps to copy a UI form:

. Select the *UI forms* section in the left-hand menu.
