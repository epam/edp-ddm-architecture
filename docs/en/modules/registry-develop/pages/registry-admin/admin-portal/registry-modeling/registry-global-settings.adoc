Currently, the registry administrator can configure the following parameters: ::

* xref:#support-email[Support service mailing address]

* xref:#registry-full-name[Full registry name]

* xref:#registry-short-name[Abbreviated registry name]

* xref:#ui-theme[Interface theme]

The list of settings will be expanded in the future.

CAUTION: Editing the components of the registry regulations can only be done within change candidate versions. For the master version, only the view option is available.
