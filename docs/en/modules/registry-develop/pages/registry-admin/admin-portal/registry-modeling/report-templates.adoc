== Overview

The *Report templates* section of the Regulations administrator portal contains a list of the registry's analytical reports in JSON format developed in the corresponding instance of the Report modeling service (Redash Admin).

Here you can view and download these objects for further publication in the regulations.

IMPORTANT: This section does not depend on the selected version of the regulations. Any changes apply to all versions of the registry regulations, including the `master` version.
