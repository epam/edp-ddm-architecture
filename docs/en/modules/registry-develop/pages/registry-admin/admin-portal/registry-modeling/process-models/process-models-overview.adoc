The functionality allows you to: ::

* Copy processes
* Upload processes
* Sort processes
* Categorize processes
* Delete processes
* View and edit process components, namely:

** Manage process names
** View and edit the processes XML representation code
** Build processes in the BPMN constructor

[CAUTION]
====
Editing the components of the registry regulations is only possible within change candidate versions. For the master version, only the view option is available.

Within the master version, the regulation modeler can:

* View available business processes
* Sort business processes
* View components of business processes on the *General*, *Code*, and *Builder* tabs

For more information on working with regulation versions, please refer to the page:

[WARNING]
====
Recommendations for saving and deleting objects in the Regulations administrator portal:

* Please note that there are no warning windows in the Regulations administrator portal, so be particularly careful when working with objects.
* Exercise caution and attentiveness when saving or deleting objects such as business processes, forms, and so on.
* Before creating or deleting an object, it is recommended to check it to avoid unforeseen consequences.
* Please be aware that deleting or modifying an object may result in data loss and disruption of business processes.
