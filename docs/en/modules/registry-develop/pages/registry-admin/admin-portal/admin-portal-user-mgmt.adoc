The *User management* section allows you to import registry users (officers) through a CSV file. After uploading the file, users and all their privileges are automatically created in the system.

NOTE: This section is independent of the selected version of the regulation. Any changes apply to all versions of the regulation, including the master version.

The execution result of the import process and possible errors can be viewed in the technical logs of the Kibana service.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The registry administrator must be provisioned with the `user-management` role for importing users from a CSV file. Please ensure this role is assigned within Keycloak's `-admin` realm. If you find yourself without this role and try adding users, you'll be greeted with a validation error saying, "Sorry, something went wrong."

The system also maintains an audit of user uploads to the system. For this purpose, the Redash service provides a "User Management Log".
