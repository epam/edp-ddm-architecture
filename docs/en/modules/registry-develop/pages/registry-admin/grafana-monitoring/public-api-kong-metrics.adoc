== Dashboard overview

The Platform features a Grafana dashboard designed to monitor performance metrics and the volume of requests made to public integration points from unauthenticated users and third-party systems.

The registry's technical administrators can utilize data from the dashboard to monitor trends and the state of metrics. This information can assist in determining the need for optimization adjustments, such as altering request limits.

== Accessing the dashboard

To view the dashboard, follow these steps:

. Log in to the *Control Plane* administrative panel.
. Select your registry > `Edit` > +++<b style="font-weight: 700">Quick Links</b>+++.
+
TIP: For more on quick links, refer to the page xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-quick-links.adoc[].

. Follow the link to the Platform's monitoring web interface â€“ *Grafana*.

== Viewing dashboard metrics

For monitoring the performance and tracking requests to your API, utilize the metrics dashboard. Continuously monitoring these metrics will help you identify potential API performance issues and address them timely.

Select the public endpoint for which you want to view metrics. This can be done in the *public endpoint* section. Choose either all the created points or specific ones.

* The *Request rate* section shows the number of requests for each integration point.

** *Total requests per second (RPS)* displays the overall volume of API requests per second.
** *RPS per route* analyzes the volume of requests for each route individually.

+

* The *Requests by status code* sections (*_2xx, 4xx, 5xx, and other_*) present statistics on successful requests, client errors, server errors, and other response codes.
+

* The *Latencies* section indicates the server's response time to requests.

** *Request time per route* denotes the average server response time for each route.
+

** *Kong Proxy latency per route* reflects the delay between the server receiving a request and sending its response.
+

** *Upstream time across per route* determines the time the server takes to process the request and receive a response from the upstream service.
