[NOTE]
====
Search criteria in the database are view tables (`VIEW`), intended solely for reading data. The naming convention for search conditions at the data model and DB levels coincides, with the only exception being that a suffix `_v` is added to the name of each search criterion in the DB.

For example, if you created a search condition named `get_parent_by_name`, then in the database, this name transforms into `get_parent_by_name_v`.
