[NOTE]
====

In the database, search conditions are presented as view tables intended only for reading data. The naming convention for search conditions at the data model and database levels coincide with one exception: in the database, the `_v` suffix is added to the name of each search condition.

For example, if you created a search condition called `get_parent_by_name`, the view table will have the following name: `get_parent_by_name_v`.
