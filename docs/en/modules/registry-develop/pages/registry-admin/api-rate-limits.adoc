== Overview

TIP: *Rate limiting* is a network traffic limiting strategy.

*_API rate limits_* are limits of the number of HTTP requests to the service or route per a defined period. It is set _in seconds_.

The mechanism of API Rate Limits is based on the https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting/[Rate-Limiting]-plugin for Kong API Gateway. If the service/route does not have an authentication level, the limit will be set for the client's IP address. Otherwise, the HTTP header can be used for limiting, for example, user ID, user role ID, or user organization ID.

[CAUTION]
====
It is imperative that the _rate-limiting plugin is executed after the OIDC-plugin_!

This means that the OIDC-plugin priority must be higher than the rate-limiting plugin priority, which is https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/kong/plugins/rate-limiting/handler.lua#L49[910 by default]. The mechanism is described in detail further.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
//розгорнутих екземплярів Kong API Gateway.
All rate-limits are calculated within one Kong API Gateway instance. If there are _n_ Kong API Gateway instances, then the general number of requests from the user can be _n_ times the set limit value.

Kong API Gateway is deployed on the registry services level.

== Rate-limits operation principle for non-authenticated users

Limits can only be set by IP address for non-authenticated users (`config.limit_by: ip`).

----

. The user sends a request to the platform. The request goes to Kong API Gateway.

. The request is processed by the Kong Rate-Limiting plugin, which decides if the request limit was achieved by the user, based on the given service/route rules.
. If the user did not achieve the request limit, the request is rerouted to the corresponding service for processing.
. The user receives a response from the service.
.If the user achieved the request limit, the Rate-Limiting plugin responds with the `HTTP 429` error.
====

== Rate limits operation principle for authenticated users

If the service/route has an authentication level, then the limit can be set not only for IP-address, but for any authenticated user or user group.

In this case, the request's own `"token-claim"` header value can be used to calculate the limit, as the header contains user data, such as user ID, role, organization ID, etc. This header can be added using Kong OIDC-plugin.

. The user sends a request to the platform. The request goes to Kong API Gateway.
. Kong OIDC-plugin gets to process the request, checking user session. +
. If the user was successfully authenticated (active session present), then the OIDC-plugin adds two headers to the request: one with the user's JWT-tokens, and one `"token-claim"` that contains the claim attribute value from the user's access token. From this point, the rate-limiting plugin will use the `"token-claim"` header to calculate rate-limits for the authenticated user, or user group.

. The limit can be set by IP-address, as well as `"token-claim"` header value.
. If the user did not achieve the request limit, the request is rerouted to the corresponding service for processing.

=== Setting up header for authenticated user

The values of `"token-claim"` header that contains user info can be used to calculate limits for authenticated users. You can set the values via Kong OIDC-plugin configuration. The header can include the value of root attribute (`claim`) from the user's access JWT-token.

.Example: configuring Kong OIDC-plugin to add "token-claim" header
====
.OIDC Config
[source,yaml]
-----------------
config:
  token_claim_header_value: "sub"
-----------------

In this case, `"token-claim"` header will be added after processing the request by OIDC-plugin. The header will be taken from the `"sub"` (claim) attribute of the user access token.

As a result, we get a `"token-claim"` header that contains user ID. This header can be used in the rate-limiting plugin to calculate limit by user ID.

.Rate-Limiting Config
[source,yaml]
-----------------
config:
  limit_by: header
  header_name: "token-claim"
-----------------
====

For more complex limit calculations, you can add your own dedicated attribute to the JWT-token. This is done via https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_protocol-mappers[Keycloak protocol mappers].

== Configuring rate-limits

=== Rate-limits configuration mechanism

The mechanism is based on https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting/[Rate-Limiting]-plugin for Kong API Gateway.

Kong Rate-limiting is a part of Kong API Gateway and is deployed along with it.

The Rate-limits configuration mechanism goes as follows: ::

. The administrator creates and edits the configuration file in _.yaml (.yml)_ file for *OIDC* and *Rate-Limiting* plugins Kong API Gateway.
. Changes are saved in the corresponding catalog of Gerrit-repository.
. Jenkins checks the repository for changes and applies the changed configuration for all the deployed instances of Kong API Gateway within the registry.
+
.Rate-limit configuration scheme
====
image:registry-admin/api-rate-limits/Rate-limit-configuration.drawio.png[]
====

[CAUTION]
====
To configure limits for authenticated users or user groups assembled by a certain attribute, you need to add header with said attributes to the request. Based on the attribute values, the Rate-Limiting plugin will calculate limits for each authenticated user or group individually. Use OIDC-plugin to add the headers with user attributes, as it allows you to add your own `"token-claim"` header with the JWT-token value (see xref:#header-setup-unauth-user[]_ for details).
====

=== The process of configuring limits in values.yaml

Rate-limits are configured in the _values.yaml_ configuration file, in the deployment template of the corresponding registry. Registry deployment metadata is stored in the `control-plane-gerrit` component -- central Gerrit repository.

[TIP]
====
As an example, let's look at the `registry-tenant-template-registry-dev-minimal` registry template that contains the minimum resource configuration for the deployed registry (_see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-create-registry.adoc[]_)
====

[NOTE]
====
* Rate-limits are turned off by default.
* A security administrator with the corresponding access rights can turn them off.
====

. Open the central Gerrit repository `control-plane-gerrit` in a local environment.
. Open the configuration file of the corresponding registry deployment template.
+
The route to the file would look similar to this:
+
____
resources/repositories/templates/registry-tenant-template-<registry-template-name>.git/deploy-templates/values.yaml
____
+
TIP: As an example we'll use the _registry-tenant-template-registry-dev-minimal.git_ template for registry deployment with the corresponding resources (_minimal configuration_).
+
image:registry-admin/api-rate-limits/api-rate-limits-1.png[]

. Activate the Rate-Limiting plugin by setting `rateLimitingPluginEnable: true`.
+
NOTE: The rate-limit functionality limits the amount of requests per time unit _from the webportals_ (Officer portal, citizen portal, etc.) _to the external services APIs_ of the registry.

. By default, the Kong Rate-Limiting plugin configuration looks as follows:
+
.Configuring values.yml for Kong Rate Limiting plugin
====
[source,yaml]
----
kongPluginsConfig:
  rateLimitingPluginEnable: false
  pluginsRateLimitByHeaderRequestsPerSecond: 10
  pluginsRateLimitByHeaderRequestsPerHour: 10000
  pluginsRateLimitByHeaderPolicy: "local"
  pluginsRateLimitByHeaderFaultTolerant: "true"
  pluginsRateLimitByHeaderHideClientHeaders: "false"
  pluginsRateLimitByHeaderHeaderName: "token-claim"
  pluginsRateLimitByIpRequestsPerSecond: 10
  pluginsRateLimitByIpRequestsPerHour: 10000
  pluginsRateLimitByIpPolicy: "local"
  pluginsRateLimitByIpFaultTolerant: "true"
  pluginsRateLimitByIpHideClientHeaders: "false"
----

This configuration shows rate-limits per second and hour by:

* Header (`ByHeader`) -- only for authorized users -- `pluginsRateLimitByHeaderRequestsPerSecond` and `pluginsRateLimitByHeaderRequestsPerHour` parameters, accordingly;
* IP-address (`ByIp`) -- for all users -- `pluginsRateLimitByIpRequestsPerSecond` and `pluginsRateLimitByIpRequestsPerHour` parameters, accordingly.

IMPORTANT: For proper plugin operation, the limit valiues for `LimitByHeader` and `LimitByIP` parameters must be identical.
====

NOTE: The full list of Kong Rate-Limiting plugin configurations and capabilities is available https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting/[here].

. After configuring, perform a commit into the corresponding repository.

== Displaying errors on Portal forms on exceeding the service request limits

Exceeding the number of permitted requests from the `admin-portal`, `officer-portal`, and `citizen-portal` to backend API services causes errors that are displayed in the UI.

If the rate limit is exceeded when trying to access portal pages, the access is blocked, and the user is redirected to `HTTP 429` error page.
