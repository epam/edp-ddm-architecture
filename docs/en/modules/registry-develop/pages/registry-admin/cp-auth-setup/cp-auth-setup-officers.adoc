= Configuring authentication for officers
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====

Changing the authentication type is available for the registry versions *`1.9.3`* and later.

All earlier versions of the registry use the authentication with the Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) and the IIT widget, which is the default authentication type for the Officer portal.
====

== General description

Registry administrators can configure the desired authentication type for the Officer portal. The platform allows using their [.underline]#own IIT widget# for authenticating with a Qualified Electronic Signature or configuring integration with an external provider *`id.gov.ua`*.

[TIP]
====

Links to official resources: ::

* Institute of Information Technologies (IIT) -- https://iit.com.ua/

* Integrated System of Electronic Identification (ICEI) ID.GOV.UA -- https://id.gov.ua/
====

Registry officers will be able to use only one type of authentication at a time when logging into the Officer portal: either a Qualified Electronic Signature or *`id.gov.ua`*.

== Authenticating with the IIT widget

. Log in to the *Control Plane* console as a registry administrator.
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/update-cluster-mgmt-01.png[]
+

. Go to the *Registries* section, open the necessary registry, and click on *`EDIT`*.
+
[NOTE]
====

You can also configure authentication type for the officers during the registry creation.

+
image:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup-officers/cp-id-gov-ua-iit-setup-02.png[]
+

. Select the *Officer authentication* section and perform the following configuration:
+

* [.underline]#Specify the authentication type# as `Widget`. This type is intended for authenticating officers using the Qualified Electronic Signature on the login form of the Officer portal.
+

TIP: `Widget` is the default authentication type.
+

* [.underline]#Add a link to the resource with a widget#. The standard IIT widget is at the following URL: https://eu.iit.com.ua/sign-widget/v20200922/.
+
[NOTE]
====

You can use a widget from any provider with a different URL, but in that case, pay attention to the height parameter, which can be configured in the next field (_see below_).
====
+

* Define the widget height in pixels (px). By default, the parameter is set to `*720*` px for the IIT widget.
+

NOTE: Increase or decrease the height as needed. For example, *`1000`* px. Pay special attention to this if you use the URL of another provider to ensure the Qualified Electronic Signature widget appears correctly in the Cabinet.

. Click kbd:[Confirm] to save the configuration.
+

This will result in a merge request to the registry configuration.
+

. Go back to the registry details and find the section *Update requests*.
+
image:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup-officers/cp-id-gov-ua-iit-setup-3.png[]
+

. Open the generated request by clicking on the view icon - üëÅ.
+

NOTE: The proposed changes will be saved to the registry configuration in the _deploy-templates/values.yaml_ file upon confirmation.
+

. In the new window, compare the 2 versions of the changes, make sure the data you entered is correct, and click kbd:[Confirm]. You can also reject the changes to the configuration immediately by clicking kbd:[Reject].
+

TIP: The comparison window allows you to conveniently check the current (left) and new (right) versions of the changes.
+

+
[NOTE]
====

Registry officers will be able to use only one type of authentication at a time when logging into the Officer portal: either a Qualified Electronic Signature or `id.gov.ua`.

When switching the authentication type, the parameters for the other type remain unchanged. Thus, [.underline]#two configurations can coexist# at the same time, but [.underline]#only one can be active#. When changing the `browserFlow`, the excessive resources in the Helm chart are deleted.

In our example, the standard `browserFlow` is used for authentication via Qualified Electronic Signature -- *`dso-officer-auth-flow`*.
====

+

As a result, the request obtains the `Confirmed` status and triggers the Jenkins pipeline *`MASTER-Build-<registry-name>`*, where [.underline]#`<registry-name>`# is name of the registry. It applies the parameters of the specified configuration.
+

. Wait while the code is being built. This may take up to 15 minutes.
+

You can check the current status and execution result by following the *`CI`* link in the interface.

Upon successful completion of the build, the specified configuration will be applied to the registry.

== Authenticating via the id.gov.ua system

=== Prerequisites


. Register in the ICEI `id.gov.ua` system.
To do this, go to https://id.gov.ua/connect and conclude an electronic agreement on access to the integrated system of electronic identification.
+
[NOTE]
====

The conclusion of the agreement and other related legal and technical procedures are performed on the `id.gov.ua` side between the data owner (_registry technical administrator_) and ICEI.
====

. After registering as a client (of the registry), obtain the client identifier in the `id.gov.ua` system (`client_id`) and the password (`secret`) from ICEI.

. Use the obtained data to configure authentication with `id.gov.ua` in the *Control Plane* interface.

=== Configuring

. Log in to the *Control Plane* console as the registry administrator.
+

+

. Go to the *Registries* section, open the necessary registry, and click *`EDIT`*.

image:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup-officers/cp-id-gov-ua-iit-setup-02.png[]
+

. Select the *Officer authentication* section and perform the following settings:
+

* [.underline]#Specify the authentication type# as *`id.gov.ua`*. This type is intended for authenticating officers using an external provider on the Officer portal login form.
+

* [.underline]#Add a link to the resource#. For example, the URL may look like this: https://test.id.gov.ua?auth_type=dig_sign.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====

In the request's query parameters (in the URL after *`?`*), specify the authentication types available for the official through `id.gov.ua`.

Possible values for the `auth_type` parameter:




* *`dig_sign`* - authentication with a Qualified Electronic Signature (_digital signature_);
* *`bank_id`* - authentication via `BankID`;
* *`diia_id`* - authentication via `Diia.Sign`.



‚ùó Specify only *`auth_type=dig_sign`*, as shown in the example.
This is due to the fact that the `BankID` and `Diia.Sign` methods do not pass the `edrpou` parameter, which is necessary for successful authentication of the official in the system. Other parameters required for successful official authentication - `drfo` and `fullName` (see xref:user:citizen-officer-portal-auth.adoc[] for more details).

====
+

* [.underline]#Specify the client identifier (`client_id`)# obtained in the `id.gov.ua` system. For example, *`17f33242543e4340b690391d6f1d1513`*.
+
[TIP]
====

The client identifier in the `id.gov.ua` system is similar to the https://www.uuidgenerator.net/[UUID] format but without the hyphens (`-`) between characters.
====
+

* [.underline]#Specify the client secret (`secret`)# obtained from the `id.gov.ua` system.
+

TIP: This can be any randomly generated password in the `id.gov.ua` system.
