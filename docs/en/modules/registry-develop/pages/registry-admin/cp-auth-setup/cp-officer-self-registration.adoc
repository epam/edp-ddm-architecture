== General description

The platform provides the ability to configure self-registration for officers, simplifying the registration process for users without the need for administrator involvement.

This creates several advantages for organizations and users: ::

* Efficiency: reduces the time and effort administrators spend on creating user accounts, especially in registries with a large number of users.

* User autonomy: allows users to create their own accounts in the system without additional assistance from the administrator.

* Reduced errors: The self-registration process typically involves verifying the data entered by users, reducing the likelihood of administrator errors when creating user accounts.

* Time savings: With self-registration, users can quickly access the system and start using its functionality without waiting for administrator approval.

== Setting up self-registration for officers

Registry administrators can configure self-registration for officers through the *Control Plane* administrative panel, in the *Registries* > *Officer authentication* section.

When enabled, officers can automatically register in *Keycloak* -- the system for user and access management. Upon the user's first login to the Officer portal, their account is created with the system role `unregistered-officer` assigned, and the user is automatically redirected to the self-registration business process.

NOTE: It is not recommended to grant the `unregistered-officer` role access to any business processes except for self-registration in the registry authorization file _bp-auth/officer.yml_.

When self-registration is disabled, authentication for officers follows the standard process, where users need to be initially created in the user management system (see
xref:registry-admin/create-users/overview.adoc[] for more details).

To enable or disable self-registration for officers, follow these steps: ::

. Log in to the *Control Plane* administrative panel.
. Go to the *Registries* > *Edit* > *Citizen authentication* section.
. Toggle the switch to allow or disallow self-registration.
+
NOTE: When the ability is turned off, users who have started the self-registration process will not be able to complete their tasks if they are modeled.

[NOTE]
====
User self-registration requires that a pre-modeled self-registration business process is already created in the registry.

For more details see xref:best-practices/bp-officer-self-register-manual.adoc[].

. Click the kbd:[Confirm] button to save the changes.
+
This will result in a merge request to the registry configuration, which needs to be confirmed.

. Go back to the *Registries* > *Update Requests* section and review the new request by clicking the "View" icon -- üëÅ.

. In the new window, review the changes and click kbd:[Confirm].
+
NOTE: The proposed changes will be applied to the registry configuration in the _deploy-templates/values.yaml_ file upon confirmation.
+
The setting is controlled by the *`keycloak.officerPortal.selfRegistration`* parameter, which can be set to either `*true*` or `*false*`.

.Example 1. Setting *`selfRegistration`* to *`true`* in the _deploy-templates/values.yaml_ file

. Wait for Jenkins to apply the configuration using the `MASTER-Build-<registry-name>` pipeline. This may take a few minutes.

== Authenticating upon logging into the Officer portal

Officers can automatically start the self-registration process after logging into the portal if the self-registration business process has been pre-modeled in the registry and self-registration is enabled for that registry.

After completing the registration, the system redirects the user to the login page, this time with the `officer` role assigned. After the login the officer will have access to the services available in the registry.
