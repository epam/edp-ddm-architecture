If you need to debug a service remotely from your local machine, follow these steps to connect.

. Log in to the *OpenShift* console.

. Navigate to the *Workloads* > *Deployments* menu. Select your project from the *Project* dropdown list where the remote service connection will be used. In the search bar, enter the name of the service, and from the filtered results, select the necessary one, for example, `user-task-management`.
+
NOTE: Before editing registry resources in Openshift, consult with the Platform administrator for rights to edit YAML configurations and port forwarding within the registry namespace, as these rights are not granted by default to the registry administrator.

. Go to the *YAML* menu, and in the editor window, add the following value for the `JAVA_OPTS` property:
+
[source, yaml]
----
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005

.. Select the *Command line tools* menu.
.. Choose the utility from the list to download according to your operating system.
.. Open the downloaded file.

. Obtain the token for authentication in OpenShift.

.. Click on your profile name in the upper right corner of the page and select the *`Copy login command`* menu item.
+

.. Re-authenticate in the system.
.. Click *`Display Token`*.
.. Copy the value from the *Log in with this token* field.
+

. Execute the copied command in the command line (CMD), for example:
+
[source, bash]
----
oc login --token=sha256~1aWEXnvr4IBVNaaaaaaaAAQ10NkhokA9aa-s_-trO8k --server=https://api.example.com:6443
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you encounter an `error: x509: certificate is not trusted` error during login due to a missing certificate on the API endpoint `https://api.example.com:6443`, use the `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag to bypass TLS verification. For instance:

[source, bash]
----
oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify --token=sha256~1aWEXnvr4IBVNaaaaaaaAAQ10NkhokA9aa-s_-trO8k --server=https://api.example.com:6443
----
====

.. Next, select the appropriate project by executing the command:
+
[source, bash]
----
oc project some_name
----
+
where `some_name` is the name of your project.

.. Retrieve the pod identifier of the service by executing the command:
+
[source, bash]
----
oc get pods
----

.. Execute the port forwarding command:
+
[source, bash]
----
oc port-forward user-task-management-c8b9695d6-rg92b 5005:5005
----

. Add a new configuration in *IntelliJ IDEA*.

.. Go to the menu:Run[Edit Configuration...].
+
image:registry-develop:registry-admin/remote-connection/remote-connection-7.png[]

.. Click *`Add New Configuration`* and select the *`Remote JVM Debug`* configuration type.
+
image:registry-develop:registry-admin/remote-connection/remote-connection-8.png[]

.. Specify the name, check the settings, and click *`OK`*.
+
image:registry-develop:registry-admin/remote-connection/remote-connection-9.png[]

. Start the service.
+

. The service can now be intercepted on the local machine on the subsequent request.
