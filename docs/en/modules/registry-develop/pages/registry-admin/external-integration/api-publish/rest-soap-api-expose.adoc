= Configuring the regulations to provide access to data via SOAP and REST APIs
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

If your registry is the data owner, and you wish to establish integration API points, receive requests, and provide data to other registries and systems, configure the following regulations settings:

. xref:#authorization-settings[Set up authorization and grant permission to call the business process].
. xref:#target-registry-bp-modeling[Model the business process to be called by another registry].
. xref:#create-data-model[Create a data model and provide read access to the registry data via the API representation)].

[NOTE]
====
For REST interactions, you must also grant access to the registry in the *Control Plane* admin console. For details, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-registry-grant-access.adoc[].

[#authorization-settings]
== Setting up authorization to access the registry business processes

Registry administrators must set up authorization at the registry regulations level.

[NOTE]
====

Configure the following files: ::

* *_bp-auth/external-system.yml_* defines access to business processes

* *_bp-trembita/external-system.yml_* configures the exchange of parameters for starting the business processes
====

. Set up access to the business processes in the target registry, which will provide a data exchange API.
+
To do this, configure the _bp-auth/external-system.yml_ file in the regulations:
+
.A configuration that grants access to the business processes in the target registry
====
[source,yaml]
----
authorization:
  realm: 'external-system'
  process_definitions:
    - process_definition_id: 'my-process-id'
      process_name: 'Your business process name'
      process_description: 'Your business process description'
      roles:
        - 'trembita-invoker'
----
====
+
In this example, access to the `my-process-id` business process is granted for the `*trembita-invoker*` role from the `*-external-system*` Keycloak realm. The `process_name` and `process_description` parameters are optional and do not affect authorization.
+
IMPORTANT: The `*trembita-invoker*` client with the same role is automatically created by the Keycloak operator in the `*-external-system*` realm when the registry is deployed. All external systems that require access to the registry on the Platform must use this client's credentials.

. Configure the *_bp-trembita/external-system.yml_* file in the regulations:

.. Configure the start variables for the business process. To do this, specify which parameters the business process will expect in the *`start_vars`* section.
+
IMPORTANT: If *`start_vars`* are not defined, the business process will not work.

.. Configure the return variables. To do this, specify which parameters the business process will return in the *`return_vars`* section.
+
.Configuring an API contract for a business process
====
[source,yaml]
----
trembita:
  process_definitions:
    - process_definition_id: 'my-process-id'
      start_vars:
        - eduname
      return_vars:
        - id
        - name
----
====
+
In this example, the `*my-process-id*` business process in a target registry requires start variables to run. Without them, the process cannot be initiated. In particular, the process expects the `eduname` parameter to contain a student's name.
+
TIP: For an example of accepting variables in a target process, jump to xref:#target-registry-bp-modeling[].

.. Configure the return variables. In this example, the business process will return the `id` and `name` parameters. They will be written to the result variable in the *Output Parameters* of the same service task with the delegate.

[#create-data-model]
== Configuring the data model

Create a registry data model. Add new search conditions to provide read access to database data through the registry API representation.

[TIP]
For details on configuring the data model, see xref:registry-develop:data-modeling/data/physical-model/rest-api-view-access-to-registry.adoc[].

[#target-registry-bp-modeling]
== Modeling the business process to be called in a target registry

Model a business process that other registries will call to obtain data. This can be any process within your registry's business logic.

[NOTE]
====
To start a business process in your registry, the system needs to accept the incoming start variables it expects. This is done using a scripted task, as shown in the following example.

include::partial$snippets/demo-reg-reference-examples-en.adoc[]

An example of a BPMN process diagram will be available in the demo-registry's regulations by searching for the keywords -- *_create-school-auto-sign_*. The names of the forms can be found inside the corresponding User Tasks of the business process in the *`Form key`* field.
