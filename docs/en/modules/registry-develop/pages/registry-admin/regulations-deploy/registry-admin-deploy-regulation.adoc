This guide provides instructions on deploying pre-configured registry regulations.

TIP: For an overview of the registry regulations' main elements, see xref:registry-admin/regulations-deploy/registry-regulations-structure.adoc[].

Step 1 ::
Sign in to the registry's *Gerrit* code review system.
+
[TIP]
====
You can obtain the *Gerrit* link in the *OpenShift* web console. Go to *Networking* > *Routes*, select your project, search for `gerrit`, and copy the link from the *Location* column.

====
+
In Gerrit, go to *Browse* > *Repositories*. Find the registry regulations' repository called *registry-regulations*.
+

Step 2::
Open the *registry-regulations* repository by clicking its name and copy the entire `git clone` command from the *Clone with commit-smg hook* field. Save it in any text editor. This command copies the remote repository to the local machine.
+

Step 3::
Start the link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[*Git Bash*] terminal from the directory to which you want to clone the repository. Paste the command you copied in step 2 into the console and run it.

[TIP]
====
You can obtain the credentials in your Gerrit user profile in the *Settings* > *User Settings* > *HTTP Credentials* section.

+
After the remote repository is copied successfully, it becomes available on the local machine.

Step 4::
+
Copy the pre-configured regulations files to their corresponding subdirectories inside the *_registry-regulations_* directory. You may copy the regulations files from a working registry and modify them if needed.
+
Open the Git Bash terminal from the directory containing the regulations that are ready for deployment.
+
image:registry-admin/regulations-deploy/registry-deploy-regulation-05-en.png[]
+
Execute the following commands in the Git Bash terminal:
+
[source, bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Message commit with changes"
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
----
+
[TIP]
====
Where:

* `git add .` adds all files _(locally)_

* `git commit -m "Message commit with changes"`:
** `git commit` updates the registry regulations _(locally)_
** `-m` adds a comment to the commit
** `"Message commit with changes"` is a placeholder for the comment message

* `git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master`:
** `git push origin` pushes local changes to the remote repository containing the registry regulations
** `HEAD:refs/for/master` is the path to the master branch of the remote repository
====
+
As a result, the local regulations files are deployed to the Gerrit repository.

Step 5::
Go to *Gerrit* > *Changes* > *Open* and ensure the change is created.
+

Step 6::
Open the change you created and follow the review procedure.
+
Click `Reply`.
+

+
In the new window, apply the following votes:
+
--
* `+2` for *Code-Review*

* `+1` for *Verified*
+
TIP: `+1` for *Verified* can be set manually, but it is not mandatory.
We recommend waiting for the automatic validation through the Jenkins pipeline (CI Jenkins).
This process may take a few minutes.
--
+

+
Click *`SEND`*, then click *`SUBMIT`* to merge the changes to the remote repository (`git merge`).
+
image:admin:user-management/user-management-55.png[]
+
In the dialog, click *`CONTINUE`*.
+

Step 7::
In *Gerrit*, go to *Changes* > *Merged*. Find your change, open it, and ensure that the *CI Jenkins* pipeline named *MASTER-Build-registry-regulations* is running. Wait until it is completed.
+
--
* To monitor the pipeline in Jenkins, use one of these options:

** Click the *CI Jenkins* link in the *Change Log* section.
** Alternatively, open the *Jenkins job* using the link at the bottom of the page.
+

* In Jenkins, click *`Back to Project`* in the leftmost menu.
+
image:admin:user-management/user-management-58.png[]
+
* Verify that the build is successful. All the build stages must be completed without errors and marked with green.

[CAUTION]
====
If there are any errors during the regulations build, you must look through the logs to find the issue causing the error, solve it, and perform the update again.

For an example of analyzing the Jenkins logs for errors, see xref:registry-admin/regulations-deploy/registry-regulations-auto-validation.adoc#example-validation-fk-name[Automatic validation for the foreignKeyName attribute].
====

[NOTE]
====
Data model tables prefixed with `test_` in their names will be skipped during deployment.

[source, XML]
----
<createTable tableName="test_table" ext:historyFlag="true">
    <column name="role_id" type="UUID" defaultValueComputed="uuid_generate_v4()">
        <constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="pk_pd_subject_role"/>
    </column>
    <column name="role_name" type="TEXT">
        <constraints nullable="false"/>
    </column>
</createTable>
----
====

After the Jenkins job is completed successfully, the registry regulations entities are created, and you can proceed to validate them.
