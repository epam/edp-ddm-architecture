. Go to the *Attributes* tab and set values for the parameter keys: *`drfo`*, *`edrpou`*, *`fullName`*, which are mandatory for authentication with the user's Qualified Electronic Signature (_see xref:user:citizen-officer-portal-auth.adoc[]_). A new parameter is added after you click the kbd:[Add] button.
+
[CAUTION]
====

If the attribute values do not correspond to the values specified in the Qualified Electronic Signature, the user will not be able to access the Officer portal or sign the Qualified Electronic Signature tasks.

* *`KATOTTG`* _or_ Codifier of administrative-territorial units and territories of territorial communities (_to be filled in for registries using the territorial role model_) - a list of codes from the Codifier of administrative-territorial units and territories of territorial communities. After determining the code, the abbreviated value of the code should be recorded in Keycloak. The user of the Officer portal will have access to records of the specific region/district/territorial community, etc., whose code is indicated.

To view the decryption of the code KATOTTG, please follow the link:https://www.minregion.gov.ua/napryamki-diyalnosti/rozvytok-mistsevoho-samovryaduvannya/administratyvno/kodyfikator-administratyvno-terytorialnyh-odynycz-ta-terytorij-terytorialnyh-gromad/[link].

Find the most up-to-date file _Codifier_. For convenience, use additional filtering by the *Object Category* column of the file, which contains the following values:
|===

|Level|Value

|First level|*`O`* - Autonomous Republic of Crimea, regions

*`K`* - cities with special status

|Secod level| `*P*` - districts in regions and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea

|Third level| *`H`* - territories of territorial communities (names of territorial communities) in regions, territorial communities of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea

|Fourth level| *`M`* - cities

*`T`* - urban-type settlements

*`C`* - villages

*`X`* - settlements

|Additional level|*`B`* - districts in cities
|===

Example 1: ::

To provide user with access to the Officer portal at the level of the _Myrhorod_ territorial community (Third level) in Poltava region, do the following:

* select the value *`H`* in the *Object category* column.

* enter the name of the territorial community *`Myrhorodska`* in the *Object name* column as a search query.

* copy the code value of the territorial unit (*`UA53060230000098362`*) from the "Third level" column.

* according to the decryption below, determine which blocks are the last non-zero ones, delete all zero blocks along with the system number, and enter only this value into Keycloak. In Example 1, you need to enter *`UA5306023`* into Keycloak (blocks up to the level of territorial communities are non-zero).

+

Example 2: ::

To provide user with access to the Officer portal at the level of _Shevchenkivskyi_ district in Poltava city (Additional level), do the following:

* first, select the value *`O`* in the *Object category* column.

* enter the name of the region *`Poltavska`* in the *Object name* column for search.

* copy the code value of the region *`UA53000000000028050`* from the *First level* column.

* use the filter to leave only the values in the *First level* column that contain the value *`UA53000000000028050`*.

* select the value *`B`* in the "Object Category" column.

* enter the name of the district *`Shevchenkivskyi`* in the *Object name* column as a search query.

* copy the code value of the territorial unit (*`UA53080370010339303`*) from the *Additional level* column.

* according to Example 1, determine which blocks are the last non-zero ones, delete all zero blocks along with the system number, and enter only this value into Keycloak. In Example 2, you need to enter *`UA530803700103`* into Keycloak (blocks up to the level of districts in cities are non-zero).

If a user has access to multiple territorial units, their codes are entered into Keycloak with a separator `##`. The maximum number of values for one user is 16.

If you are granting a user access to records of the entire Ukraine, within the *KATOTTG* field only two characters should be specified: *`UA`*
