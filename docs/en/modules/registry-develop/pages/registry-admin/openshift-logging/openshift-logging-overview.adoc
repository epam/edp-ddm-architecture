= Reviewing the Platform event logs (Kibana)

This section provides detailed instructions on using Kibana, part of the *EFK* stack (*Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana*) for logging within the system. The EFK stack collects, processes, and visualizes event logs, fostering transparency and system state tracking.

The event logging subsystem is deployed in a separate project in OpenShift titled `*openshift-logging*`. This approach isolates logging resources from other system components, enhancing security and stability.

*Kibana* is used to visualize logs from all applications on the platform. It offers an interactive interface for log analysis and tracking system events. With its help, users can easily detect and resolve issues and gather essential metrics about the performance of platform services and registries.
