= Business process modelers

:sectanchors:
:sectlinks:

The *_Business Process (BP) modelers_* craft the core of the Registries Platform â€” *Business Processes*, which underpin all services offered.

Using tools like the *_Administrative portal_*, _Camunda Modeler_, and standards like *_BPMN_* and _DMN_, BP modelers design *_processes_*, *_UI forms_*, and *_integrations_*.
Complex models often incorporate *_Groovy scripting_*, *_JUEL functions_*, and *_JSON structures_*. Modelers and developers employ *_REST and SOAP connectors_* for interactions with external systems or other Registries on the Platform.

For more details on BP modeling, see the section pages.
