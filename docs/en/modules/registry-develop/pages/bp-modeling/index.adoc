= Business process modelers

:sectanchors:
:sectlinks:

The *_Business Process (BP) modelers_* craft the core of the Registries Platform — *Business Processes*, which underpin all services offered.

Using tools like the *Administrative portal*, Camunda Modeler, and standards like *BPMN* and DMN, BP modelers design *processes*, *UI forms*, and *integrations*.
Complex models often incorporate *Groovy scripting*, *JUEL functions*, and *JSON structures*. Modelers and developers employ *REST and SOAP connectors* for interactions with external systems or other Registries on the Platform.

For more details on BP modeling, see the section pages.
