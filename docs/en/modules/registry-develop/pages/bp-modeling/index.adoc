= Business process modelers

:sectanchors:
:sectlinks:

The *_Business Process (BP) modelers_* craft the core of the Registries Platform â€” *Business Processes*, which underpin all services offered.

Using tools like the *Administrative portal*, Camunda Modeler, and standards like BPMN and DMN, BP modelers design processes, UI forms, and integrations. Complex models often incorporate Groovy scripting, JUEL functions, and JSON structures. Modelers and developers employ REST and SOAP connectors for interactions with external systems or other Registries on the Platform.

For more details on BP modeling, see the section pages.
