* *`Calculated value`*: allows to calculate the value of a component based on other data or conditions. Unlike *Custom default value*, the value of the field will be calculated every time any changes occur on the form - the user enters data, it is completed by http requests. This function uses JS insert. xref:bp-modeling/forms/components/general/eval.adoc[More about JS inserts.]
** *`JavaScript`*: adjust your own value with javascript help.
** *`JSONLogic`*: adjust your own value with help of https://jsonlogic.com/[JSONLogic, window=_blank].
