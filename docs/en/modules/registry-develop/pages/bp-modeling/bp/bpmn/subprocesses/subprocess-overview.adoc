= Subprocesses

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

This section dives into *subprocesses* in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) business process modeling. *_Subprocesses_* are essential for breaking down complex processes into more manageable, smaller parts. Here's what you'll learn about:

* [*] *Embedded subprocesses:* These are contained within a parent process and are executed as part of the more significant process flow.
* [*] *Call activities:* Call activities allow for reusing other processes or subprocesses, promoting modularity and efficiency.
* [*] *Event subprocesses:* These are triggered by specific events, adding flexibility and responsiveness to process handling.
* [*] *Transaction subprocesses:* These model transactions in a way that ensures all steps within the subprocess are completed successfully or none at all, enhancing reliability and consistency.

Understanding subprocesses will equip you to structure your business processes in BPMN, leading to improved organization, scalability, and execution precision.
