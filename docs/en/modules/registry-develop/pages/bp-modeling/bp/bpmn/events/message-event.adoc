== Overview

*_Message event_* is a business process event used to transfer information from one business process to another one, or a subprocess. The generated outgoing message (sender-event) activates the element that receives the corresponding message (receiver-event).

image:bp-modeling/bp/events/message-event/message-event-01.png[]

The event elements that send and receive messages _must be interconnected_ and have the corresponding information exchange configuration.

The following types of message events are used in modeling: ::

. xref:#message-end-event[*Message End Event*] -- an event that is modeled at the end of a business process or subprocess. It is configured to send a data array, certain attributes, or a text message.

. xref:#message-start-event[*Message Start Event*] -- an event that is modeled at the initiation of a business process or subprocess start. It is configured to receive a data array, certain attributes, or a text message from End Message Event or Message Intermediate Throw Event element.

. xref:#message-intermediate-throw-event[*Message Intermediate Throw Event*] -- an event that is modeled during business process or subprocess running. It is configured to send a data array, certain attributes, or a text message.

. xref:#message-intermediate-catch-event[*Message Intermediate Catch Event*] -- an event that is modeled during business process or subprocess running. It is configured to receive a data array, certain attributes, or a text message from End Message Event or Message Intermediate Throw Event element.

== Message End Event modeling and configuring

To model and configure Message End Event, make the following configurations:

[IMPORTANT]
====

Prerequisites ::

Prepare 2 modeled business process within 2 pools that will interact with each other via messages (_here we will use *Send Message* and *Receive Message_* processes).
====

. Add a process end event in the *Send Message* business process.

+

. Select the process end event and define its type by clicking the _key icon_ and selecting *Message End Event* in configuration.

+
image:bp-modeling/bp/events/message-event/mess1_2.png[]

. On the *General* tab configure a delegate for message data sending:

* In the `Id` field, enter element identificator, or use the default value.
* In the `Name` field, enter element name.
* In the `Implementation` field, select `Delegate Expression` from the list.
* In the `Delegate Expression` field, enter delegate value -- `${startProcessByMessageDelegate}`.
+
NOTE: As opposed to other delegate expressions for business process modeling that have xref:bp-modeling/bp/element-templates/element-templates-overview.adoc[developed templates], the `startProcessByMessageDelegate` delegate used in Message events is configured manually.

* Expand the *Details* block by clicking the `+` button.
* In the `Global Message Name` field, enter a name for the message receiving element (for example `startProcessReceiveMessageAfterSystemTask`).
+
[CAUTION]
====

The name must be identical for two interconnected elements - the data sending element, and the data receiving element.

One message sending element can be interconnected with only one message receiving element.
====

* In the `Global Message referenced` field, select data receiving element link value from the list (referenced in `Global Message Name` field).
+
[CAUTION]
====

If several interconnected elements of message events are used in the business process modeling within one _.bpmn_-file, then the dropdown list will show all the previously set values of message receiving elements. Be attentive when configuring this parameter and select the corresponding element.

When changing values in the `Global Message referenced` field, an identical value automatically fills in the `Global Message Name` field.
====

+

. Navigate to the *Input\Output* tab and configure data array, attributes or text message that will be transferred to the receiving business process or subprocess:

* Click the `+` button in front of the *Input Parameters* section. This will automatically enter the incoming parameter, which you need to configure according to the data that is to be transferred to the other business process or subprocess.

+
image:bp-modeling/bp/events/message-event/mess1_4.png[]

* In the `Local Variable Name` field, enter the name for the local variable, or use default name.

+
image:bp-modeling/bp/events/message-event/mess1_5.png[]

* In the `Variable Assignment Type` field, select variable type and configure it in the following way:

+
[TIP]
====

There are for ways to assign the variable:




* `String or Expression`;
* `Script`;
* `List`;
* `Map`.

====

* When selecting `String or Expression` type, set the transferred variable expression in the `Variable Assignment Value` field via JUEL-function.

+
[TIP]
====

You can find more details on the JUEL-functions supported by the Platform on the following page: xref:bp-modeling/bp/modeling-facilitation/modelling-with-juel-functions.adoc[].
====

+
image:bp-modeling/bp/events/message-event/mess1_6.png[]

* When selecting `Script` type, enter script data in the `Script Format`, `Script Type` and `Script` fields.

+
image:bp-modeling/bp/events/message-event/mess1_7.png[]

* When selecting `List` type, click `+` (`Add Value`), and set variable value (text or JUEL-function) in the `Value` field.
+
image:bp-modeling/bp/events/message-event/mess1_8.png[]

* When selecting `Map` type, click `+` (`Add Entry`), set variable name in the `Key` field, and set variable value (text or JUEL-function) in the `Value` field.

+

* If needed, click `+` in front of the *Input Parameters* section, and configure the next variable value.
