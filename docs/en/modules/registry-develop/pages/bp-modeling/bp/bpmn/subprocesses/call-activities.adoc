== Overview

*_Call Activity_* is a standard BPMN-modeling element supported by Camunda Engine. It allows you to call another process as part of the currently running process. *Call Activity* is similar to xref:bp-modeling/bp/bpmn/subprocesses/embedded-subprocess.adoc[embedded subprocess], but is external, meaning it's modeled within a separate business process pool, and can be used multiple times by different Parentfootnote:[*Parent Process* is a process that initiates subprocess start. A subprocess is a *Child Process* to a *Parent Process*.] business processes.

[NOTE]
====
In Camunda BPM the calling of global (external) subprocess can be executed between processes modeled in separate _.bpmn_ files, or within a single _.bpmn_ file. This way an independent business process can start another one, and vice versa.

The registry platform currently supports only one type -- calling a global subprocess from a Parent process. From a global subprocess you can execute the Call Activity -- a subprocess of the 2nd level (_see xref:#restrictions[]_).

====

When a Call Activity element is brought into action, a new instance is created for the process the element is linked to. The new instance is activated during none-startfootnote:[*None events* are undefined events, also called "empty."] event. The process can have start events of other types, but they are ignored.

[NOTE]
====
When the created instance is ended, the call action is stopped, and the sequence flow continues.

In other words, when Call Activity is executed, the process that initiated the call awaits the end of the global subprocess, and continues after that.
====

== Types of Call Activity element template extensions

To simplify business process modeling within the registry Platform, a number of extension (delegate) types that are configured using the developed Call Activity element templates, were implemented:

. xref:bp-modeling/bp/element-templates/call-activities/call-activity.adoc[*Call Activity*] -- general template for global subprocess call.
. xref:bp-modeling/bp/element-templates/call-activities/check-excerpt-status.adoc[*Check excerpt status*] -- specialized template for the calling of check excerpt status subprocess.

CAUTION: We differentiate Call Activity as a BPMN element and Call Activity as this element's extension that is configured using the _callActivity.json_ developed template, used to call the global subprocess.

[#element-temp-call-activity]
== Modeling business processes using Call Activity extensions

Let's look at the application of Call Activity BPMN-element using _callActivity.json_ developed template-extension to call global subprocesses on the example of online order processing business processes (_further in the text -- main or parent process_) and confirmation of the order (_further in the text -- subprocess_).

[TIP]
====
On the modeling stage it is required to create 2 business process pools and save them within one _.bpmn_ file.
====

=== Process modeling stages

To model 2 processes (the parent process and the global subprocess in our case) using Call Activity, we need to go through the following stages:

. xref:#create-pool-bp-1[].
. xref:#bp-start-event[].
. xref:#bp-user-form-insert-data-online-order[].
. xref:#bp-call-activity[].
. xref:#create-pool-bp-2[].
* xref:#bp-start-event-called-process[].
* xref:#bp-user-form-approval-decision[].
* xref:#bp-script-task[].
* xref:#bp-end-event-called-process[].
. xref:#bp-user-form-order-payment[].
. xref:#bp-end-event-caller-process[].

[#create-pool-bp-1]
=== Creating parent process pool

_To model a pool for the parent process_, take the following steps:

NOTE: Parent process pool modeling must be performed within the *Create Pool/Participant* element.

. Open *Camunda Modeler* and create a new BPMN diagram by clicking *File* menu > *New File* > *BPMN Diagram*.
+
image:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/modeling-instruction/bp-1.png[]

. On the left panel, find *Create pool/Participant* and drag it onto the modeling canvas.
+
image:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/modeling-instruction/bp-2.png[]

. Fill in the fields with the corresponding values:

* In the `Participant Name` field, enter the name for the pool -- `Creating an order on the website`.
* In the `Process id` enter business process ID -- `create-order`.
* In the `Process Name` field enter process name -- `Creating an order on the website`.

+

[#bp-start-event]
=== Modeling start event of the parent process

_To model a start event_, take the following steps:

. On the left panel, find the *CreateStartEvent* and drag it onto the modeling canvas.
. On the right panel, fill in the following parameters with the corresponding values:
* In the `Name` field, enter the name for the start event -- `Cart`;
* In the `Initiator` field, enter `initiator`.

+
TIP: `initiator` -- is a special variable set for the user who started the process.
+

[#bp-user-form-insert-data-online-order]
=== modeling the user task for entering online order data

_To create a user task for data entering, take the following steps:_

. Create a new task, define its type by clicking the key icon and selecting *User Task* from the menu.
. On the right panel, click `Open Catalog`, select *User Form* template, and click `Apply` to confirm.
. On the right panel, fill in the following fields:

* In the `Id` field, set task ID -- `user-form-1`.
+
TIP: Task ID is automatically set by default. Enter it manually if required.

* In the `Name` field, enter task name -- `Order data form`.
* In the `Form key` field, enter form key that will correspond with the form service name -- `add-order-bp-add-order-test`.
* In the `Assignee` field, enter the variable of the user who initiated the process instance -- `${initiator}`.

[#bp-call-activity]
=== modeling Call Activity to call external subprocess

_To model Call Activity, take the following steps:_

TIP: You can find an example of Call Activity delegate configuration xref:bp-modeling/bp/element-templates/call-activities/call-activities-overview.adoc[here].

. Create the *Call Activity* element.

. Perform the following configurations:

* In the `Name` field, enter element name -- `Decision on order confirmation`.

* In the `Called Element` field, set the ID of the global xref:#create-pool-bp-2[subprocess to be called] -- `order-confirm`.

* In the `Input data` field, set the input data to be sent to the called business process. The parameters must be transferred in the form of _key-value_ pairs (here -- `${submission('user-form-1').formData}`).

+
TIP: You can find more detauls on using the `submission()` function on the following page: xref:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/modeling-facilitation/modelling-with-juel-functions.adoc[].

* In the `Output variable name` set the payload-carrying variable name (here -- `callActivityOutput`).

+
image:bp-modeling/bp/subprocesses/call-activities/bp-call-activity-5.png[]

NOTE: This way the current configuration starts xref:#create-pool-bp-2[a global subprocess] from the main pool. The main process can't end while the global subprocess is running.

[#create-pool-bp-2]
=== Creating a pool for the global subprocess

_Model a pool for the global subprocess_ as shown in the example xref:#create-pool-bp-1[].

. Fill in the following fields with the corresponding values:

* In the `Participant Name` field, enter the name of the pool displayed in the modeler -- `Decision on order confirmation`.

* In the `Process id` field, enter business process ID -- `order-confirm`.

* In the `Process Name` field, enter business process name -- `Decision on order confirmation`.

_Create a script task for data processing and preparation for output_.

[TIP]
====
The task purpose is to take the data that the user filled in the form, using groovy-script with `submission()` function, form an output in JSON format, and write it into `callActivityOutput` variable, defined in `Output variable name` field when modeling xref:#bp-call-activity[Call Activity] of the main process.

[#restrictions]
== Restricting nesting levels when calling subprocesses with Call Activity

The Platform has certain restrictions on how many nesting levels are allowed for business processes during the calling of global subprocesses with Call Activity.

[CAUTION]
====

For proper calling of global subprocesses with Call Activity functionality operation, use no more than 3 nesting levels for bysiness processes. This means the _main process, global subprocess of the 1st level, and global subprocess of the 2nd level_.
====

== Displaying business processes in user Portals

Users of Officer and Citizen Portals will see only the names of parent business processes of the highest level on [.underline]#My services# and [.underline]#My tasks# pages during the execution of called or in-built subprocesses.

If business process `A` called subprocess `B`, and subprocess `B` called subprocess `C`, the user will _only see business process A name_ in the Portal.
