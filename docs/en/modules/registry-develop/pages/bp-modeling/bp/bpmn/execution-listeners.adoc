== Overview

*_Execution listeners_* are objects triggered at vital moments in the execution of business processes. They enable the integration of additional logic that might not be directly related to the process's main tasks. You can attach listeners to process elements, such as start and end events, tasks, gateways, etc. Listeners are commonly used for logging, executing scripts, sending notifications to users, gathering data about process execution, and more.

== Using execution listeners for error logging

Developers often use execution listeners to log information about errors, which provides effective tracking and analysis during integration with external services.

Consider using a listener attached to an Error boundary event to log error details when a request to an external service fails.

.Groovy script for logging
[source,groovy]
----
org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass()).error(
  execution.getProcessDefinitionId() + '(' + execution.getActivityId() +
  '): Error when receiving citizen info, error message: ' + errorMessage)
----

This code creates a log entry that includes the process identifier (`execution.getProcessDefinitionId()`), task identifier (`execution.getActivityId()`), an error message (`errorMessage`), specified in the *Message variable* field of the *Error boundary event*. This simplifies the identification of the error context and its correction process.

Using execution listeners for error logging is an essential tool for developers. It allows for detailed recording of errors that occur during the execution of business processes, facilitating quick response to them, optimizing system performance, and enhancing its reliability.
