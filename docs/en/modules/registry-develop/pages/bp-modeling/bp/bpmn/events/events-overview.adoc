In this section, you'll explore *events* within the context of business process modeling using BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). *_Events_* are crucial in defining how processes start, progress, and conclude. We'll cover the main types of events in detail:

* [*] *Link events:* Utilized to connect different parts of a process, simplifying organization and management.
* [*] *Message events:* Enable the modeling of message exchanges between participants, which is critical for effective communication.
* [*] *Timer events:* Establish time conditions for processes, aiding in managing deadlines and schedules.
* [*] *Error events:* Allow for efficient response to mistakes and unexpected situations within a process.

Understanding these events will enhance your grasp of BPMN and its application in business process modeling, making your processes more flexible and manageable.
