*_Business Processes (BP)_* are the basis for all services provided by Registries on the Platform. They are based on BPMN -- as standardized notation for representing and modeling business processes that allow organizations to streamline operations, improve efficiency and communication between service providers and recipients. BP modelers use dedicated BPMN tools to create, edit, emulate, and execute Business Processes.

BP modeling is an extensive section that includes many topics. You can learn more about them on dedicated pages.
