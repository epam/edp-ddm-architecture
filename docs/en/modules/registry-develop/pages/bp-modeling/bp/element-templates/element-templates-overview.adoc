CAUTION: This section is still under development. Content may be incomplete or updated soon.

This section introduces you to *Element Templates*—tools that make business process modeling easier and more intuitive. These templates help you quickly configure integration with APIs and streamline process setup for your use case.

== How it works

*Element Templates* are ready-to-use configuration blueprints (also known as *_delegates_*) that you can apply at any stage of a business process. They’re available directly in the xref:registry-admin/admin-portal/overview.adoc[Admin Portal], allowing you to configure process tasks—such as *User Tasks*, *Service Tasks*, and *Call Activities*—without writing custom logic.

Each template includes only the required parameters for a specific task, helping you work more efficiently and avoid misconfiguration.

== Integration and extension

Element Templates are stored in the open-source repository `https://github.com/epam/edp-ddm-registry-configuration/tree/main/element-templates[edp-ddm-registry-configuration]`.
If you use external modeling tools such as Camunda Modeler,
you can download templates from this repository and add them to your local `/element-templates` folder.

For detailed setup instructions, see xref:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/element-templates/element-templates-install.adoc[Installing business process extensions].

== Why use Element Templates?

Element Templates offer several benefits:

* [*] *Efficiency and precision* – They simplify integration with APIs and reduce setup errors.
* [*] *Process standardization* – They help enforce consistency in how business processes are modeled and executed.
* [*] *Flexibility and adaptability* – You can tailor the templates to fit your business needs and goals.
