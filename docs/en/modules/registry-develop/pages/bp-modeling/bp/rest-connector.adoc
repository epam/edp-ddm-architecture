= Integration with external services using the REST connector
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

You can use the `REST connector` to connect to secured services or systems outside the Platform cluster.

This guide describes the steps required to set up the connector.

[#create-service-entry]
== Creating a Service Entry

Before a request for an external resource can go beyond the Platform cluster, you need to create a *Service Entry* at the registry level to serve as an entry point for the outbound traffic.

[NOTE]
====

A Service Entry is created automatically after the registry administrator configures the integration in the Control Plane admin console. Once the changes are applied to the registry configuration and the *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`* Jenkins pipeline runs, the connection to the external system is set up.

For details on Control Plane settings, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-ext-system.adoc[].
====

[WARNING]
====

For registry versions 1.9.2 or earlier, a Service Entry is created automatically after the publication pipeline is launched and changes to the registry regulations are deployed.
====

You can check whether the Service Entry was created using the `*ServiceEntries*` list in the OpenShift console.

. Sign in to the OpenShift web console.

. Go to *Home* > *API Explorer*.
. In the *Filter by kind* search field, search for `ServiceEntry` and select the corresponding service.
+

. From the *Project* dropdown list, select the registry that will use the external service.
. Open the *Instances* tab and find the required `ServiceEntry`.

[#create-secret]
== Creating a secret for service authorization

[WARNING]
====

For registry versions 1.9.3 or later, there is no need to create secrets manually in Openshift.

The secrets (such as a token or password) are created automatically after the external system interaction settings are applied via the Control Plane admin console.

Once the changes are applied to the registry configuration and the *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`* Jenkins pipeline runs, a secret for external service authorization is created along with the Service Entry. The secret is added to the *user-management:hashicorp-vault* for the system or service to which requests will be made.

For details on configuring interactions with external systems, see xref:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-ext-system.adoc[].
====

To create the secret manually, perform these steps:

. Sign in to the OpenShift web console.
. Go to *Workloads* > *Secrets* and select your project from the *Project* dropdown list.
. Select *`Create`* > *Key/value secret*.
+
image:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/rest-connector/rest-connector-6.png[]

. Enter the name of the secret into the *Secret name* field. For example: `httpbin-basic-authentication`.
+
NOTE: You will need the name of the secret for the `*secret-name*` parameter when configuring the regulations. For details, jump to xref:#regulations-configuration[].
+
image:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/rest-connector/rest-connector-7.png[]

. Specify the type of service authentication to use:

* For `BASIC` authentication, add two *Key* parameters:
** `username`
** `password`
+
image:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/rest-connector/rest-connector-8.png[]

* For `PARTNER_TOKEN` authentication, add one *Key* parameter:
** `token`
+
image:registry-develop:bp-modeling/bp/rest-connector/rest-connector-9.png[]

. Once the settings are applied successfully, the secret is created. You can use this secret for authorization in the external service.

[#regulations-configuration]
== Configuring the regulations

[WARNING]
====
For registry versions 1.9.3 or later, the main integration settings are performed at the registry instance level in the Control Plane admin console. For details, see xref:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-ext-system.adoc[].

At the registry regulations level, the administrator configures only the following: ::

* system name
* allowed operations:
** endpoint and resource path
** method

.external-systems config in the bp-trembita/configuration.yml file for registries version 1.9.3 or later

For registries version 1.9.2 or earlier, perform the configuration at the registry regulations level.

To do this, you need to configure the `*external-systems*` block in the *_bp-trembita/configuration.yml_* file of a corresponding registry.

[NOTE]
====
* The `external-systems` header must be followed by the name of the external service, for example, `httpbin`.
* The `url` parameter must contain the service address, for example, `http://httpbin.org/`
* The `methods` header must contain the name of the method used to interact with the service, for example, `get`.
** The `path` is the path to the service, for example, `/get`.
** The `method` is the HTTP method of interacting with the service, for example, `GET`.
* The `auth` header must contain the secret parameters:
** The `type` is the authentication type: `BASIC` or `PARTNER_TOKEN`.
** The `secret-name` is the name of the secret, for example, `httpbin-basic-authentication`.
