== Problem statement

We use https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html[Liquibase] to create a registry physical data model for PostgreSQL.

By default, Liquibase supports objects deployment and versioning in DB, meaning the creation/deletion of tables, creation of connections between these tables, creation of views, configuration of constraints, etc.

For this purpose, Liquibase has a number of constructions -- https://docs.liquibase.com/change-types/home.html[**change types**], each one defining a certain version of changes to the DB, and is formed with XML-tags. For example, `<createTable>`, `<dropTable>`, etc.

Within the Registry Platform, Liquibase is used as the sole instrument for operations with physical data model in PostgreSQL, and its standard functionality is insufficient to cover all the possible scenarios of work with registry regulations.

For this reason, the following solutions have been developed:

- _liquibase-ext-schema_ Liquibase scheme that expands the standard Liquibase tags and attribute list with new *Platform*-specific ones
- _liquibase-ddm-ext_ Liquibase extensions library that includes program processing of tags and attributes added in _liquibase-ext-schema_, and modifies the behavior for default tags and attributes


== General description

*liquibase-ddm-ext* is a library that expands https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html[Liquibase] functionality, and is responsible for the processing of XML-tags and attributes that may be used in registry regulations modeling.

This library adds the processing of _Platform_-specific new tags and attributes, and also changes the processing logic for some of the tags included in Liquibase by default.

== Implementation principles

The extension uses all the main principles provided to Liquibase developers and users (https://www.liquibase.org/get-started/core-usage[details]), and uses the mechanisms provided to extensions developers (examples of other extensions created by Liquibase developers for open use: https://github.com/orgs/liquibase/repositories).

== Usage scenarios

The solution is used within regulations publication pipeline (_registry-regulation-publication-pipeline_) on data model deployment stage (_create-schema_ stage of the _registry-regulations-data-model_ pipe) for the filling of registry DB scheme, and creation of the metadata required to generate data-model services.

== Adjacent components

- *registry-regulation-publication-pipeline* - calls the Liquibase-utility on regulations publication stage
- *dataplatform-jenkins-agent* - imports the library to `pom.xml` for further usage by regulations publication pipeline
- *liquibase-ext-schema* - extended XSD-scheme of Liquibase tags and attributes that may be used in *Platform* registry development. It is included in all regulations files processed by Liquibase using _liquibase-ddm-ext_
- *service-generation-utility* - generates the _registry-model_, _registry-rest-api_ and _registry-soap-api_ services, using database scheme, filled by Liquibase using _liquibase-ddm-ext_

== Diagrams

In the general process of data model deployment by the regulations publication pipeline, the execution of required Liquibase-scripts by the extension is performed on the `create-schema` stage.
