== Overview

_The quality attribute defines the capability of a system to process any request within a restricted time interval, and provide the processing of the required requests number in the set time interval without an increase in the time defined for their processing._

The _Registry Platform_ performance requirements are represented by two key metrics:

* _Latency_ -- time delay between request sending and receiving system response (95th percentile)
* _Throughput_ -- system channel; capacity, defined by the number of processed requests in a set time period

== Target metrics

When defining target values for the aforementioned metrics, the classification of Registries, operational conditions and expected workload is taken into account.
