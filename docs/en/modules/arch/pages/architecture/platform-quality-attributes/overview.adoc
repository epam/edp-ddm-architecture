== General description

This section shows the non-functional requirements that the _Registries Platform_ must fulfil.

For each quality attribute, the following information is provided: overview of approach, implementation in solution architecture, key metrics. Additionally, links to the technical design of the corresponding subsystems, and sections with detailed descriptions are provided.

Registry classification and operation conditions are taken into account when defining target values for metrics.

By purpose, we differentiate the following Registries:

* _Strategic_ -- intended for general use by all subjects of information relations within given authority and (or) rights.
* _Tactical_ -- intended for specialized use by a restricted list of subjects within given authority.
* _Operative_ -- intended for dedicated use by a restricted list of subjects within given authority; typically not the master-Registry for other Registries.

We differentiate the following Registry operation conditions:

* _Production hours_ -- officer's work hours, 8 to 18 on weekdays
* _Peak hours_ -- 3 hours during production hours
* _Evening hours_ -- +2 hours after production hours
* _Shadow hours_ -- all other hours

|Quality attribute|Description

|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-portability.adoc[Portability]|This quality attribute defines the extent of system independence from the type of infrastructure it can be deployed on.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-scalability.adoc[Scalability]|This attribute defines the capability of a system to process growing workloads without serious drops in general performance, or the capability to instantly adapt by increasing resource provision.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-availability.adoc[Availability]|This attribute defines the percentage of time the system is available and ready to process requests.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-performance.adoc[Performance]|This attribute defines the capability of a system to process any request within a restricted time interval and provide the processing of the required requests number in the set time interval without an increase in the time defined for their processing.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-security.adoc[Security]|This attribute defines the capability of a system to protect data and information from unauthorized access, providing access to authorized users and systems at the same time.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-observability.adoc[Observability]|This quality attribute defines the capability of a system to record and provide detailed information in the form of event logs, monitoring metrics, and user transaction tracing data, in order to simplify problem identification and solving by system administrators.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-auditability.adoc[Auditability]|This quality attribute defines the capability of a system to record and provide information on important technical and business events, connected with system operation by end users. The provided information may be used to detect and solve problems in system functionality.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-interoperability.adoc[Interoperability]|This quality attribute defines the capability of a system to effectively interact with other systems for data exchange.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-operability.adoc[Operability]|The quality attribute defines the presence and level of capabilities for servicing and managing system settings during operation.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-modifiability.adoc[Modifiability]|The quality attribute determines the level of complexity and speed of making changes to the system to expand functionalities and correct defects.
|xref:arch:architecture/platform-quality-attributes/platform-verifiability.adoc[Verifiability]|The quality attribute determines the level of complexity for testing and debugging the system when changes are introduced.
