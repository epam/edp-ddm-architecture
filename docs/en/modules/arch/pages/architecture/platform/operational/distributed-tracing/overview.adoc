== Overview

_The Request Tracing Subsystem_ assists administrators and registry developers in tracking, profiling, and debugging in microservice-oriented distributed systems like the Registry Platform. It provides the ability to trace requests as they navigate through a complex architecture, allowing administrators and developers to understand how different Platform services interact and where there might be performance issues.

_The Request Tracing Subsystem_ comprises several components: agents, collectors, a storage repository for traces, and a query service. Agents collect data from microservices and forward it to the collectors. Collectors store and index this data, and the query service facilitates the searching and visualization of this data in a user-friendly manner.

The subsystem allows for tracking individual requests across multiple Platform services and viewing detailed information about each request, such as response time, error rate, and service dependencies. This information can be utilized to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize service communication, and enhance the overall system reliability.

== Subsystem Features

* Visualization and analysis of tracing data, enabling developers to identify problems and optimize their systems quickly.
* Display of request chain and individual request execution times.
* The subsystem provides detailed metrics for tracing data, such as the number of collected spans, the number of discrete traces, and the number of errors encountered.
* Searching request chains based on request identifiers (`trace_id`).
* The subsystem features a user-friendly web interface for the visualization and analysis of tracing data, facilitating quick problem identification within the Platform.

[NOTE]
====
A span represents a segment of code that measures the execution time of an operation and gathers information about it, such as an identifier, the start and end time of the operation, and tags that describe the operation's context.

A trace is a sequence of spans that form a request structure. Each span has a unique identifier, thus allowing for the assembly of a tree of spans, displaying the sequence of operations and their dependencies during the request execution.

== Subsystem quality attributes

=== _Observability_
The _Request tracing subsystem_ provides a comprehensive overview of the Platform's behavior, allowing administrators and developers to monitor performance, detect anomalies, and identify potential operational issues.

=== _Performance_
The _Request tracing subsystem_ offers unobtrusive instrumentation support for tracing and efficient data storage and indexing. This functionality enables high-performance monitoring of requests within the Platform without expending excessive computational resources.

=== _Scalability_
The _Request tracing subsystem_ is designed considering large volumes of tracing data, supporting horizontal scalability and distributed data storage.

=== _Security_

An additional proxy component protects the user interface. In conjunction with the centralized xref:architecture/platform/operational/user-management/overview.adoc[Users and roles management subsystem], it is responsible for granting access and segregating rights. By default, users are granted minimal rights necessary to accomplish their tasks.

A mechanism is present to restrict access to the interface, which minimizes the subsystem's attack surface from the outside.

All events within the subsystem are logged and available for further analysis when needed by the xref:arch:architecture/platform/operational/logging/overview.adoc[Event logging subsystem].

The subsystem does not have access to sensitive data and does not store it.
