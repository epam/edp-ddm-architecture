= Event monitoring and notification subsystem
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/arch-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

== Overview

The _Event monitoring and notification subsystem_ is responsible for collecting monitoring data from applications, and infrastructure stores information as a time series (`time series`). It offers capabilities for constructing search queries and allows the creation of alerts based on these queries.

== Subsystem functions

* Collection and storage of monitoring data from Platform and Registry components.
* Generation of alerts based on monitoring data.
* Visualization based on monitoring data.
* Provision of a unified interface for metrics collection.

== Technical design

The following diagram depicts the components of the _Event monitoring and notification subsystem_ and their interaction with other subsystems.

//TODO: Translate diagram, it is already exported as svg + embedded images
image::architecture/platform/operational/monitoring/monitoring-subsystem.drawio.svg[width=800,float="center",align="center"]

The _Event monitoring and notification subsystem_ can be expanded with custom alert receivers (Alertmanager Receivers) and the creation of custom dashboards in addition to the default ones.

== Subsystem quality attributes

=== _Scalability_

The event monitoring and notification subsystem is designed with horizontal scaling in mind to support large clusters and high volumes of metrics from the Platform and registries.

=== _Reliability_

The event monitoring and notification subsystem employs stable and reliable components, such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager, to provide accurate and consistent solutions for monitoring the Platform and registries and analyzing the collected metrics.

=== _Extensibility_

The event monitoring and notification subsystem offers flexible mechanisms and extension points for custom dashboards or custom notification channels that aren't supported by default (e.g., telegram, etc.).
