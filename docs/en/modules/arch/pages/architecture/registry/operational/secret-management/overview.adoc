== Overview

The _Secrets and encryption management subsystem_ handles the encryption of sensitive registry data and synchronizes secrets upon request from the target registry services by creating and monitoring the `ExternalSecret` resource.

== Subsystem functions

* Storing the encryption/decryption keys.
* Synchronizing and updating secrets between xref:arch:architecture/platform-technologies.adoc#vault[HashiCorp Vault] storage and the container orchestration platform.

== Technology stack

The following technologies were used when designing and developing the subsystem:

* xref:arch:architecture/platform-technologies.adoc#vault[HashiCorp Vault]
* xref:arch:architecture/platform-technologies.adoc#reloader[Reloader]
* xref:arch:architecture/platform-technologies.adoc#ext-secrets-operator[External Secrets Operator]

== Subsystem quality attributes

=== _Security_

The subsystem uses strong encryption algorithms to store sensitive data and implements reliable access control.

=== _Observability_

The subsystem records detailed information about authentication attempts, secrets retrieval, and other operations, enabling you to meet compliance requirements.

Also, the subsystem supports incoming requests logging and collecting performance metrics for analysis through the web interfaces of respective Platform subsystems.
