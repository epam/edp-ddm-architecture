include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/arch-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

== Overview

The subsystem is designed to manage external traffic and control access to API services of the registry operational zone.

== Subsystem functions

* Authentication and authorization of requests
* Traffic routing to API services of the registry operational zone subsystems
* Configuration and control of rate limits
* Transformation of requests and responses
* Logging of incoming requests
