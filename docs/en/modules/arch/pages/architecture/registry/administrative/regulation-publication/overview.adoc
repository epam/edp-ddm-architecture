== Overview

The registry regulations deployment subsystem verifies the integrity of the changes made to the xref:architecture/registry/administrative/regulation-management/registry-regulation/registry-regulation.adoc[registry regulations] and automatically applies them to the subsystems of the xref:architecture/registry/operational/overview.adoc[registry operational zone].

== Subsystem functions

* Tracking changes to the registry regulations

* Validating the integrity of the registry regulations

* Deploying temporary databases for version candidates

* Applying changes to the registry database schema

* Generating code for registry data access services

* Deploying registry data access services

* Deploying changes to business processes and UI forms

* Creating user roles for the registry

* Configuring access rights to business processes

* Applying changes to external integration and cross-registry interaction settings

* Deploying changes to report and excerpt templates

* Deploying changes to user notification templates

* Applying changes to registry settings and customization

* Storing artifacts of registry data access services

* Resetting operational zone subsystems to the default state (regulations cleanup)

* Configuring simulation rules for external integrations

* Configuring geodata management subsystem

== Subsystem quality attributes

=== _Deployability_

The main task of the subsystem is to deploy the regulations changes to the corresponding subsystems of the registry operational zone as soon as they are made. The deployment is implemented using common scripting and deployment automation technologies such as _Groovy_, _Jenkins_, and _Helm_.

=== _Integrability_

The subsystem must be integrated with other subsystems of the registry operational zone. For this, the system uses _Groovy_ scripts and CLI adapters that contain complex integration logic and are developed using the _Java_ programming language and common frameworks such as _Spring_ and _Spring Boot_.

=== _Modifiability_

The registry regulations deployment pipeline is divided into separate, loosely connected steps. This enables you to safely modify the existing implementation and develop features to update new subsystems when expanding the xref:architecture/registry/operational/overview.adoc[registry operational zone].
