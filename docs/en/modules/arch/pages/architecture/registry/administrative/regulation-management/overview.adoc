include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

== General description

The subsystem that provides capability of the registry development functionality based on the _Lowcode_ principles in the form of xref:architecture/registry/administrative/regulation-management/registry-regulation/registry-regulation.adoc[_digital registry regulations_]  and provides capabilities for managing the officer accounts.

== Subsystem functions

* Modeling of the xref:architecture/registry/administrative/regulation-management/registry-regulation/registry-regulation.adoc[registry regulations components] based on the _Lowcode_ principles:

* Batch download of users.

* Amendments to the declarative description of the registry regulations.

* Versioning of the registry regulations with a history of changes.

* Monitoring of changes before entering them into the registry regulations.

* Viewing the results of monitoring of changes to the registry regulations by the xref:architecture/registry/administrative/regulation-publication/overview.adoc[Registry regulations deployment subsystem].

== Subsystem technical design

* _(1)_ -- The report archive is a zip archive that contains a list of requests and report settings in a declarative format.

* _(2)_ -- Scenarios that are relevant for modeling

* _(3)_ -- The internal structure of the Redash components is described in the xref:arch:architecture/registry/operational/reporting/overview.adoc[Registry analytical reporting subsystem]

== Subsystem quality attributes

=== Security
Only authorized users can access to the subsystem web interfaces. The standard system mechanisms, such as https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/[OpenID Connect] and https://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications[SAML] integration with the xref:architecture/platform/operational/user-management/overview.adoc[Users and roles management subsystem], are used for authorization.

=== Usability

Modeling of the regulations in the subsystem web interfaces is performed according to the principles of _Low-code_ with auto-prompts for users, auto-completion and validation of the entered information. This allows reducing the time for development of the regulations and enhancing training of users.

=== Modifiability

The structure of the subsystem's xref:architecture/registry/administrative/regulation-management/registry-regulation/registry-regulation.adoc[_digital registry regulations_] is divided onto individual elements that are loosely coupled to each other (the principle of Low coupling) and use the principles of _Low-code_ for development, which simplifies implementation of new changes to the regulations, accelerates the speed of development and reduces the required expertise of a modeler.
