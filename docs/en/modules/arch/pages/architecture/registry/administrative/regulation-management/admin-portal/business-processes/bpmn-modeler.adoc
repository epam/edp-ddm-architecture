= Modeling business processes using the web editor
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/arch-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

== Functional scenarios

- Create new _BPMN_ models of business processes.
- Make changes to existing _BPMN_ models of business processes.
- View _BPMN_ models of business processes.
- View the _XML_ code for representation of the _BPMN_ models of business processes.
- Using a catalog of typical extensions to simplify business process modeling.

== Key requirements

- Providing the administrator with a single web interface for modeling business processes without installing the special _Camunda Modeler_ software on the local machine.

- The web interface must provide the same functionalities as _Camunda Modeler_ required to work with the _BPMN_ business process models.

- Web interface modeling must support localization.

- Web interface modeling must support themes and styles for complete integration into the _Registry regulations administration system_ interface.

- Web interface modeling must support all the existing typical modeling catalog extensions developed as _Element Templates_.

- Web interface modeling must generate the _BPMN 2.0_ _XML_ code for representing the business process model compatible with the current _Camunda BPM_version.

== Support for the default _Element Templates_ extensions

The _bpmn-js_ library supports all existing typical extensions of the modeling catalog, developed as Element Templates, for this we use the _bpmn-js-properties-panel_, _element-template-chooser_ and _camunda-bpmn-moddle_ libraries. To use existing Element Templates, you must call the _setTemplates_ function and pass an array containing the Element Templates argument.

[source, javascript]
----
const viewer = new BpmnModeler({...});
viewer.get('elementTemplatesLoader').setTemplates([ELEMENT_TEMPLATES]);
----

== Support for themes and styles

The _bpmn-js_ library provides the ability to select styles and supports theme selection, based on examples given in the documentation:

* https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/theming +
* https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/colors

== Localization support

The _bpmn-js_ library provides for the localization option, based on the example given in the documentation. +

https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/master/i18n

So far, at this time it is not possible to localize the properties panel (right sidebar).
