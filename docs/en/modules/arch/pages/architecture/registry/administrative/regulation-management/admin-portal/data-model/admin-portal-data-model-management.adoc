== Principles of working with changes in the database

=== Existing mechanism for working with changes in the database

The existing mechanism for working with changes in the database is based on two principles:

- Creating the Liquibase changeset
- Saving the Liquibase changeset in git

=== Advanced mechanism for working with changes in the database

It is suggested to extend the existing mechanism for working with database changes by adding a _DataModelSnapshot_ document to the git repository, which will reflect the data model's state.

=== Basic concepts

- _DataModelSnapshot_ model: JSON documents reflecting the state of the registry regulations data model.
- Diff Document: The document showing the difference between the two states of the registry regulations data model.
- History Document: The document reflects the history of changes made to the master or candidate versions of the registry regulations.

=== DataModelSnapshot structure description

[NOTE]
The above data model was obtained from analyzing the existing state of liquibase changelogs (including the functionality analysis of the custom liquibase tags).

=== Description of the file structure in the file system

The _DataModelSnapshot_ model has the following file structure in the file system:

image::architecture/registry/administrative/regulation-management/admin-portal/data-model/tables-management-datamodel-filestructure.svg[]

- The list of tables is determined by the list of files in the file system.
- The name of the table file matches the name of the table and is `<table-name>.json`.
- The name of the role permission file corresponds to the name id role permission and is the following: `<role-id>.json`.

==== Temporary file structure in the file system (first iteration)

=== Description of the DataModelSnapshot data format

We use the JSON format as a technical tool for describing the data structure of _DataModelSnapshot_. As a description of the contract document, https://json-schema.org/ [JsonSchema] is used.
