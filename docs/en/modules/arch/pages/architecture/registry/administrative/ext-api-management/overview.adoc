== General description

The subsystem manages external traffic and controls access to the API services of the Registry administrative zone.

== Subsystem functions

* Authentication and authorization of requests
* Traffic routing to the API services of the registry administrative zone subsystems
* Setting and controlling rate limits
* Transformation of requests and responses
* Logging of incoming requests

== Subsystem technical design

== Subsystem quality attributes

=== Scalability

The external traffic management subsystem of the registry administrative zone supports both horizontal and vertical scaling.
[TIP]
--
You can read more about scaling subsystems in the section xref:architecture/container-platform/container-platform.adoc[]
--

=== Observability

The external traffic management subsystem of the registry administrative zone supports the logging of incoming requests and the collection of performance metrics for
further analysis through the web interfaces of the corresponding subsystems of the Platform.

[TIP]
--
You can read more about the design of subsystems in the relevant sections:

* xref:arch:architecture/platform/operational/logging/overview.adoc[]
* xref:arch:architecture/platform/operational/monitoring/overview.adoc[]
--

=== Portability

The external traffic management subsystem of the registry administrative zone can be migrated, deployed and managed uniformly and reliably on different
container orchestration platforms deployed in various cloud environments or own infrastructure in the data center.
