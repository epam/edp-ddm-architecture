== General overview

*_The Platform for state registries_* is an information system designed to _deliver government services in a digital format efficiently_. It enables the rapid creation, modeling, deployment, and maintenance of electronic state registries.

The main objective of this solution is to implement a _decentralized_ and _regulated_ approach to managing state registries. This product aims to balance _data security requirements_, _interoperability_, _deployment speed_, and the _cost_ of registry ownership.

== Main purpose

*_The Registries Platform_* aims to address several problems with the current state of government information registries, which complicate the process of digitizing government services:

* Many registries, owned by multiple entities, are maintained in _Excel_ with poor data quality.
* Registry information systems are outdated and require updates.
* There is a lack of registry classification and differentiation of requirements for protecting registry data.
* High costs are involved in developing and maintaining individual registries.
* Building inter-registry integrations poses significant complexity.
* The creation of each registry is determined by a separate law, leading to different definitions and approaches.
* Each registry requires the development of its infrastructure.
* There is a lack of centralized evolution of registry functionalities.

== Business drivers

* 100% of government services are available to citizens and businesses in digital format.

== Business objectives

* Building a unified government information space
* Standardizing the process of developing and operating registries
* Optimizing costs for registry development, deployment, and ownership
* Reducing demands on registry developers and administrators
* Ensuring societal trust and preventing corrupt practices
* Facilitating efficient inter-registry interactions
* Establishing the groundwork for providing digital services
* Ensuring high data storage reliability for registries

== Non-functional capabilities

* Deploying _The Platform for state registries_ in a public or private cloud environment
* Creating one or multiple registries based on a single instance of the Platform, supporting the "_Registry as a Service_" SaaS model
* Centralized distribution of updates to instances of _the Platform for state registries_
* Ensuring registry compliance of the platform registries with security, scalability, and fault-tolerance requirements
* Auditing user actions and system-critical events
* Supporting data versioning in registries
* Backup and data recovery for registries
* Monitoring and logging functionalities
* Encryption of registry data

== Functional capabilities

* _Low-code_ approach to registry development, including data models, business processes for information and administrative services, organizational structure, external integrations, and more;
* Web interface for accessing and providing government services;
* Transactional model for making changes to the registry using digital signatures for data change requests;
* Support for quick integration of registries with external systems;
//and participants through the SEVDEIR "Trembita" information exchange.
* Public API for registry data and rate limit management;
* Data access rights management using _RBAC_;
* Building analytical reports based on registry data;
* Generating extracts based on registry data and more.
