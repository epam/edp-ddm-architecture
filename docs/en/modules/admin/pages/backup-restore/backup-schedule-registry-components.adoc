= Setting up the registry components backup schedule and retention time
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

== General description

The platform provides the ability to [.underline]#manage the schedule for creating backup copies of registry components and the time span for storing such copies in the backup repository#.

Backup copies of components are created using the *`velero`* tool and stored in a secure *`minio`* backup repository located outside the Platform cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The backup schedule is configured in the https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[*unix-cron*] format on the *Control Plane* administrative panel interface.

The retention period for backup copies must be greater than or equal to one unit, be a whole number, and not contain special characters.
====

The values are stored in the registry configuration *_deploy-templates/values.yaml_* file.

The corresponding parameters are applied through the *`Create-registry-backup-<registry-name>`* Jenkins pipeline.

== Setting up a schedule

include::partial$templates/snippets/backup-restore-planning-en.adoc[]

. Log in to the *Control Plane* console as the Registry administrator.
+

. Go to the [.underline]#Registries# section and select the required one.
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/change-key/change-key-01.png[]

. Click the `Edit` button located in the upper right corner.
+
NOTE: You can also set up a backup schedule and retention time while creating a registry. However, it is not mandatory.
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/change-key/change-key-02.png[]

. Go to the [.underline]#Backup# section. Here you can set the schedule for creating backup copies and the retention period. Turn the toggle on and configure the schedule for creating automatic backup copies.
+
TIP: By default, the *Set automatic backup copy* toggle is turned off for new registries.
+

+
[NOTE]
====
The backup schedule is configured in the https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[*unix-cron*] format and is defined based on [.underline]#Kyiv time#.

By default, the `*Europe/Kiev*` time zone is set in the _values.yaml_ configuration and at the Jenkins pod level as an environment variable.

The https://24timezones.com/%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%97%D0%B2/%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81[offset] of +2 hours (`UTC+2`) in winter and +3 hours (`UTC+3`) in summer is taken into account.

Use the https://crontab.guru/[] resource, a simple and convenient cron expression editor, to better understand the logic of schedule settings.
====

* In the `Schedule` field, enter, for example, the following value: `5 11 * * MON-FRI`. Use space as a separator.
+
This means that a backup copy for the registry environment will be created every day from Monday to Friday at 10:05 according to Kyiv time.
+
TIP: After entering the backup schedule, a hint appears on the interface showing the time of the next 3 backup creation runs.

* In the `Retention time (days)` field, enter, for example, the following value: `5`. This means that the backup will be stored in the repository for 5 days.
+
NOTE: The value can only be a positive number and should not be set to less than 1 day. It is recommended to set the retention time longer than the period between creating copies.

. Click kbd:[CONFIRM] to save the changes.
+
As a result, a request for update with the status `New` will be generated.

. Go back to the `Registries` section, scroll down the page, and find the `Requests for update` section.
+
image:registry-management/cp-submit-mr/cp-submit-mr-1.png[]

. Open the generated request by clicking the view icon  -- üëÅ.
+
NOTE: The proposed changes will be applied to the *_deploy-templates/values.yaml_* configuration file upon confirmation.

. In the new window, compare the two versions of the changes, make sure the data you entered is correct, and click kbd:[Confirm]. You can also reject the changes to the configuration immediately by clicking kbd:[Reject].
+
TIP: The comparison window allows you to conveniently check the two versions of the changes: the current one (on the left) and the new one (on the right).

+
As a result, the request will change the state to  `confirmed`. At the specified time, the *`Create-registry-backup-<registry-name>`* Jenkins pipeline will be triggered. It applies the parameters of the specified configuration and creates backups in the backup repository.

. Wait until the code build is completed. This may take a few minutes.

== Checking the created backups

At the specified date and time, backups should be created according to the schedule specified in the configuration (_see --xref:#schedule-setup[]_)

You can check this as follows: ::
+

. In the registry information, open the [.underline]#Registry components# section and navigate to *Jenkins*.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components/backup-schedule-registry-components-1.png[]

. Go to the folder with the corresponding registry and select the *`Create-registry-backup-<registry-name>`* pipeline. If the pipeline is highlighted in green, the build can be considered successful.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components/backup-schedule-registry-components-2.png[]

. Open the build details.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components/backup-schedule-registry-components-3.png[]

. Go to the console output (`*Console Output*`) to view the technical log of the pipeline execution.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components/backup-schedule-registry-components-4.png[]

. Scroll down the page and make sure that the registry backup has been created.
+
.Console Output. Successful creation of registry backup
====
----
[INFO] Velero backup - external-1-2023-02-17-17-07-36 done with Completed status
----

This expression indicates that a backup has been created for the registry with a specific name (_here_ - `external-1`), the date and time of backup creation, and the successful completion status.

IMPORTANT: After the retention period expires, the backup system deletes outdated backup copies.
