= Setting up the central components backup schedule and retention time
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

== General description

The platform allows for [.underline]#managing the schedule of creating backups for central components and the time for storing such backups in the backup repository#.

The backups of components are created using the *`velero`* tool and stored in a secure backup repository called *`minio`*, located outside the Platform cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The backup schedule is configured in the https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[*unix-cron*] format on the *Control Plane* administrative panel interface.

The retention time for backups must be greater than or equal to one, be a whole number, and not contain special characters.
====

The list of central components for which backup scheduling and retention time can be configured includes: ::

* [*] Artifact repository - central component *`nexus`*.
* [*] Control panel for the Platform and registries‚Äîcentral component *`control-plane`*.
* [*] User Management - central component *`user-management`*.
* [*] Monitoring - central component *`monitoring`*.

The values are stored in the *_values.yaml_* configuration file in the *_cluster-mgmt_* repository.

The corresponding parameters are applied through the `*MASTER-Build-cluster-mgmt*` Jenkins pipeline.

== Setting up a schedule

. Log in to the *Control Plane* console as the Platform administrator.
+

. Go to the [.underline]#Platform management# section and click on *`Edit`*.
+

. Navigate to the [.underline]#Backup schedule# section and configure the settings for the required central components.
+
[TIP]
====

Currently, they are:

. Artifact repository - central component *`nexus`*.
. Control panel for the Platform and registries -- central component *`control-plane`*.
. User Management - central component *`user-management`*.
. Monitoring - central component *`monitoring`*.

[NOTE]
====
The backup schedule is configured in the https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[*unix-cron*] format and is determined by the server's time in https://24timezones.com/chasovyy-poyas/utc[UTC].

If you are configuring the schedule for Ukraine, take into account the +2 hours https://24timezones.com/%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%97%D0%B2/%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81[offset] (`UTC+2`) in winter time and +3 hours offset (`UTC+3`) in summer time.

Use the https://crontab.guru/[] resource, a simple and convenient cron expression editor, to better understand the logic of schedule settings.
====

. Configure the schedule for the *Nexus* component and set the backup retention time in days:

* In the `Schedule` field, enter, for example, the following value: `5 11 * * MON-FRI`. Use a space as a separator.
+
This means that a backup for the `*nexus*` component will be created every day from Monday to Friday at 11:05 UTC time (13:05 Kyiv time).

* In the `Retention time (days)` field, enter, for example, the following value: `5`. This means that the backup will be stored in the repository for 5 days.
+

. Configure the schedule for the *Control Plane* component and set the backup retention time in days:

* In the `Schedule` field, enter, for example, the following value: `6 11 * * MON-FRI`. Use a space as a separator.
+
This means that a backup for the *control-plane* component will be created every day from Monday to Friday at 11:06 UTC time (13:06 Kyiv time).

* In the `Retention time (days)` field, enter, for example, the following value: `6`. This means that the backup will be stored in the repository for 6 days.

+

. Configure the schedule for the *User Management* component and set the backup retention time in days:

* In the `Schedule` field, enter, for example, the following value: `7 11 * * MON-FRI`. Use a space as a separator.
+
This means that a backup for the *user-management* component will be created every day from Monday to Friday at 11:07 UTC time (13:07 Kyiv time).

* In the `Retention time (days)` field, enter, for example, the following value: `7`. This means that the backup will be stored in the repository for 7 days.

+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-cluster-mgmt/cp-backup-schedule-5.png[]

. Set up the schedule for the *Monitoring* component and specify the backup retention period in days:

* In the `Schedule` field, enter, for example, the following value: `7 11 * * MON-FRI`. Use a space as a separator.
+

This means that a backup for the *monitoring* component will be created every day from Monday to Friday at 11:07 UTC time (13:07 Kyiv time).

* In the `Retention time (days)` field, enter, for example, the value 8. This means that the backup will be stored in the repository for 8 days

. Click *`Confirm`* to save the changes.
+
As a result, a request for update with the status `New` will be generated.

. Go back to the [.underline]#Platform management# section, scroll down the page, and find the `Update requests` section.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-cluster-mgmt/cp-backup-schedule-7.png[]

. Open the generated request by clicking the view icon  -- üëÅ.
+
NOTE: The proposed changes will be saved to the *values.yaml* configuration file in the *cluster-mgmt* repository upon confirmation.

. In the new window, compare the two versions of the changes, make sure the data you entered is correct, and click `Confirm`. You can also reject the changes to the configuration immediately by clicking `Reject`.
+
TIP: The comparison window allows you to conveniently check the two versions of the changes: the current one (on the left) and the new one (on the right).
+

+
image:registry-management/cp-submit-mr/cp-submit-mr-3.png[]
+
As a result, the request will change the state to  `confirmed`. At the specified time, the `*MASTER-Build-cluster-mgmt*` Jenkins pipeline will be triggered. It applies the parameters of the specified configuration and creates backups in the backup repository.

. Wait until the code build is completed. This may take a few minutes.
+
You can check the current status and execution result by clicking the *`CI`* link on the interface.

== Checking the created backups

At the specified date and time, backups should be created according to the schedule specified in the configuration (see -- xref:#schedule-setup[]_).

You can check this as follows: ::

. Log in to the Openshift console as the Platform administrator.
. Obtain an API token for cluster access via `oc login`:

* Click `*Copy login command*`.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-cluster-mgmt/cp-backup-schedule-11.png[]

* Log in through *Keycloak*.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-cluster-mgmt/cp-backup-schedule-12.png[]

* Click `*Display Token*`.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-cluster-mgmt/cp-backup-schedule-13.png[]

* Copy the `oc login` API token.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-cluster-mgmt/cp-backup-schedule-14.png[]

. Open a terminal/console, paste the obtained token, and execute the login.
+
image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-cluster-mgmt/cp-backup-schedule-15.png[]

. Retrieve the list of backups using the command:
+
[source,bash]
----
velero get backups
----
+
As a result, you will get a list of backups for central components, including their names, statuses, creation dates and times, as well as the retention period for these backups in the repository.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the backup creation time is shown in the target time zone (UTC+2, Kyiv time), not the server time (UTC).
====

IMPORTANT: After the retention period expires, the backup system deletes outdated backups.
