== Backing up registry

include::partial$templates/snippets/backup-restore-planning-en.adoc[]

After a successful deployment of the registry and regulations, the Platform administrator can create a backup of the registry, which will be stored in a secure backup repository—*MinIO*.

To back up a registry this, follow these steps: ::

. Log in to the **Control Plane** using the previously created login and password.

. Go to the **Registries** section and select the registry for backup.

. Open the **Configuration** section at the xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-edit-registry.adoc#sections[Registry information] tab, click on the link under *CI* to open Jenkins, navigate to the *All* tab, and find the job named *Create-registry-backup-`<registry-name>`* where `<registry-name>` means the name for your registry (_see the image below_).
+
TIP: For more details on Jenkins jobs, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-edit-registry.adoc#registry-deploy-status[Checking registry deployment details]

. Open the job and click *`Build with Parameters`* to launch the *Create-registry-backup* pipeline.

. Click *`Build`*.

If the job is successfully executed, a backup of the registry with its regulations is created and uploaded to the corresponding backup repository directory.

[WARNING]
====
Backup replication of S3 buckets::

After the backup creation pipeline has run, it establishes bucket replication pipelines. These pipelines are scheduled to run at 19:30 (UTC) by default. If you need to launch the pipeline earlier, you can manually modify this schedule:

. Log into OKD.
. In the top-right corner, click Copy login command > Display Token.
. In the *Log in with this token* field, copy the token to log into OpenShift through the terminal. It might look like this:
+
.Example of oc login
[source,bash]
----
oc login --token=sha256~gQa0bxg_aaabbbcccd_D88470E-aabBcQuCn9keIM4I --server=https://api.envone.dev.registry.eua.gov.ua:1234
----

. Open the *OpenShift CLI* and execute the copied command.
+
[TIP]
For more information about *OpenShift CLI*, refer to the guide xref:registry-develop:study-project/index.adoc#preconditions-setup[Getting Started Preparations].

. Start the replication backups of the S3 buckets with the schedule desired by the user. To do this, run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
namespace="abc-02";schedule='19 12 * * *'; for cronJob in `oc get cronjob -n velero -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name" --no-headers | grep "${namespace}"`;do oc -n velero patch cronjob/$cronJob -p '{"spec":{"schedule":"'$schedule'"}}'; echo 1;done
----
+
NOTE: Replace the value `namespace="abc-02"` with the name of your registry. For example, `namespace="test-registry"`.

TIP: Also, familiarize yourself with the settings for automatic setup of S3 bucket replications on the page xref:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components.adoc[].

== Restoring registry

To restore a registry from the created backup, follow these steps: ::

. Log in to the **Control Plane** using the previously created login and password.

. Go to the **Registries** section and select the Registry that needs to be restored.

. Go to the **Configuration** section, click on the link under **CI** to open Jenkins, navigate to the *All* tab, and find the  *Restore-registry-`<registry-name>`* job, where `<registry-name>` means the name for your registry (_see the image below_).
+
image:backup-restore/registry/control-plane-create-restore.png[]

. Open the job and click *`Build with Parameters`* to launch the *Restore-registry* pipeline.
+

. Click `Build`.
+

. Next, in the parameter input step, select the backup version to restore. To do this, go to the *Console Output* section on the left panel and click *`Input Requested`*.
+
