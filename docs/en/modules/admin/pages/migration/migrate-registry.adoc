= Migrating registries
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

This page provides a practical guide for seamlessly migrating between two OKD clusters.

== Terminology

We use the following names to identify the clusters:



* [.underline]#Cluster A# is the cluster that hosts the registry _before the migration_ (source cluster).
* [.underline]#Cluster B# is the cluster that will host the registry _after the migration_ (target cluster).

NOTE: Registry migration is performed by first moving the latest backup copy of the registry from cluster A to cluster B, then restoring the registry on cluster B.

== Prerequisites for migration

Before you start the migration, check these prerequisites and ensure that all requirements are met.

. During the migration, you will need to run a bash script that transfers data from cluster A to cluster B. For a successful migration, this script must be executed on a Linux platform with an `x86-64` microprocessor architecture (also known as `AMD64`, `Intel 64`, or `x64`).

. The user performing the migration must be added as the Platform administrator on both clusters via *`control-plane-console`*.
+
TIP: For details, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-assign-platform-admins.adoc[].
+

. The Platform deployed on cluster B (target cluster) must have the same `control-plane-gerrit` version as the registry you are migrating. For example, Platform version `1.9.4.11` with `control-plane-gerrit` version `1.9.4.7` will be compatible with the registry version `1.9.4.7`. To verify the `control-plane-gerrit` version, check whether a corresponding branch exists in the `cluster-mgmt` repository of the central Gerrit component. If the branch that matches the registry version exists, the registry can be migrated to cluster B. If not, you have two options:

* Update the Platform on cluster B to match the registry version.

* Update the registry on cluster A to match the version available on cluster B.

. Make sure you have simultaneous access to clusters A and B.

. During the migration, you will need the following terminal commands:

* `oc`
* `velero`
* `rclone`
* `vault`

. Make sure you have a stable Internet connection. _The greater the bandwidth, the faster the migration will run_. Alternatively, you can use an AWS or other cloud provider's *jumpbox* with access to both clusters. Using a jumpbox reduces the time it takes to transfer the backup copy from one cluster to another.
+
[NOTE]
====

When using a *jumpbox*, you need to check whether the Platform's MinIO and Vault are accessible from the jumpbox's IP address. To get the jumpbox's IP, use the following command:
----
ssh sshmyip.com
----

Next, you need to make sure the jumpbox's IP address is added to the list of allowed CIDRs at the Platform management level for clusters A and B. For details, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-cidr-access-endpoints.adoc[].

If you cannot access `control-plane-console`, contact the L2 support team to request access.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====

Before migrating the registry, make sure cluster B does not contain any resources related to the registry.

_If the registry was never deployed on cluster B previously, skip the rest of the steps in this section._

If the registry was previously deployed on cluster B, you need to remove all of its resources by checking the following: ::


. Delete the registry from cluster B using the Control Plane admin console.
+
TIP: For details, see xref:registry-management/control-plane-remove-registry.adoc[].
+

. Confirm the changes and wait until the registry is deleted.

. After deleting the registry, verify that the project is absent in the central Gerrit component.

.. Open Gerrit (*Openshift* console > *Projects* > *`control-plane`* > *Networking* > *Routes* > *`control-plane-gerrit`*).

.. Sign in with *openshift-sso*, go to *Browse* > *Repositories*, and search by registry name.


.. If the repository appears in search results, go to *Openshift* console > *Projects* > *`control-plane`* > *Home* > *API Explorer* > search for `gerritproject` in the *Filter by kind* field -> `<registry-name>` -> *Actions* > *Delete GerritProject*.

.. After deleting the Gerrit project, go to the Gerrit console and verify that the repository is absent. If the repository exists, delete it via the Gerrit console by opening the registry repository > *Commands* > *Delete project*.

. Delete the directory in MinIO.

.. To check the MinIO directories, go to *MinioUI*. For vSphere clusters, you can find this route in *OpenShift* console > *Projects* > *`control-plane`* > *Networking* > *Routes* > *`platform-minio-ui`*.


.. If the route is missing, go to secrets using the following path: *Openshift* console > *Projects* > *`control-plane`* > *Workloads* > *Secrets* > *`backup-credentials`*, copy the `backup-s3-like-storage-url` field and add the port to the URL (for example, `https://endpoint.com:9001`).
+

TIP: To find MinIO credentials, go to *Openshift* console > *Projects* > *`control-plane`* > *Secrets* > *`backup-credentials`*. The *`backup-s3-like-storage-access-key-id`* is the username, and the *`backup-s3-like-storage-secret-access-key`* is the password.
+

.. Sign in to MinIO and delete the directories in the registry's bucket:
* _openshift-backups/backups/<registry-name>*_
* _openshift-backups/restic/<registry-name>_
* _obc-backups/<registry name>_

====

== Preparing the registry for migration

[IMPORTANT, caption=Before Migration]
Before starting the migration, it is essential to restrict end-user access to this registry completely.

. Make a backup copy of the registry on cluster A.
+

Before migrating the registry to a new cluster, run the *Create-registry-backup-`<registry-name>`* Jenkins process.
+

If the Jenkins pipeline has completed with a *Success* status, the backup copy was created successfully.
+
[NOTE]
====

To get the name of the backup copy, go to the output log from the latest Jenkins execution (*Console Output*) and look for a message similar to this:

----
[INFO] Velero backup - <registry-name>-<timestamp> done with Completed status
----

For example:

----
[INFO] Velero backup - abc-02-2023-04-18-19-03-14 done with Completed status
----

In this case, *`abc-02-2023-04-18-19-03-14`* is the name of the backup copy.

====
+
[WARNING]
====

If the registry version is earlier than 1.9.3, you need to execute the following command in the terminal:

----
velero backup describe <backup-name>
----

You can find the name of the backup in the output log from the last execution of the *Create-registry-backup-`<registry-name>`* Jenkins process.
====
+
[TIP]
====

For details on backing up and restoring registries, see xref:backup-restore/overview.adoc[].
====

. If the latest Velero backup has a *Completed* status, you can proceed. If the status of the Velero backup is not *Completed*, you will need to contact an L2-L3 support team to ensure the Jenkins pipeline functions properly.

. Prevent modifying the registry using Jenkins pipelines.
+

For each registry pipeline, go to *Configure* > *Build Triggers*, select the *Disable this project* option, then click *Save*.

== Migrating the backup copy from cluster A to cluster B

. Get login commands for both clusters.
+

To do this, sign in to the Openshift console, click your username in the upper-right corner, and select *Copy login command* from the menu. In the new window or tab that opens, copy the entire login command from the *Log in with this token* field and save it in any text editor.
+
NOTE: Do this for both clusters, A and B.

. Get the name of the latest backup copy created on cluster A (for example, `abc-02-2023-04-18-19-03-14`).

. Open the terminal and execute the following commands:
+
.Export login for cluster A
----
export A_CLUSTER_LOGIN="oc login --token …"
----
+
Copy the login command for cluster A that you saved in step 1 and paste it after the `--token` parameter inside the double quotes. Make sure there are no line breaks at the end of the login command.
+
.Export login for cluster B
----
export B_CLUSTER_LOGIN="oc login --token …"
----
+
Copy the login command for cluster B that you saved in step 1 and paste it after the `--token` parameter inside the double quotes. Make sure there are no line breaks at the end of the login command.

+
.Export registry name
----
export REGISTRY_NAME="<registry-name>"
----
+

TIP: Here is an example of the registry name: `*abc-02*`.

+
.Export backup copy name
----
export BACKUP_NAME="<backup-name>"
----
+

TIP: Here is an example of the backup name: `*abc-02-2023-04-18-19-03-14*`.
+
[WARNING]
====

If the registry was previously migrated to cluster A instead of being deployed on its Platform directly, perform an additional *`export`*:

[source,bash]
----
export VAULT_KEY="<key-name>"
----

where `<key-name>` is the key for the unseal process, which can be found in the Openshift console (Cluster A) > *Projects* -> `<registry-name>` -> *ConfigMaps* > *`hashicorp-vault-config`*. The *key_name* field is the name of the key.

For example:

[source,hcl]
----
key_name        = "autounseal-migration"
----

====
+
[WARNING]
====

When migrating a large registry, export the following variable:
[source,bash]
----
export LARGE_DATA="true"
----
====

. Download the link:{attachmentsdir}/migrate-registry/registry-migration.zip[registry-migration.zip] file, then extract it to a new directory using the following command:
+
----
unzip registry-migration.zip -d registry-migration
----
+

Go to the _registry-migration_ directory (via `cd`) and execute this command:
+
----
chmod +x && ./migration.sh
----

. After running the script, log in to the terminal via *oc cli* on cluster B and verify the following:

* Velero backup is present on cluster B.

* A directory named _keycloak-export-<registry-name>-*_ is present inside the directory with the script.

== Preparing the restore on cluster B

. Migrate realms.
+

To migrate realms, sign in to Keycloak on cluster B:


.. In the Openshift console, find the *`user-management`* project (or namespace), go to *Networking* > *Routes*, and click the *`keycloak`* link.
+

TIP: You can obtain Keycloak credentials from keycloak secrets in the same project. Go to *Workloads* > *Secrets*, search for a secret named *`keycloak`*, and copy the credentials from the *Data* section.

.. In Keycloak, go to `*Select realm*` (1) > *`Add realm`* (2) > *`Import`* (3), select the _keycloak-export-<registry-name>-*/*-realm.json_ file, and create realms using the *SKIP* strategy suggested by Keycloak. Do this for all directories with the name _keycloak-export-<registry-name>-*_.
+
image:admin:migrate-registry/migrate-registry-1.png[image,width=514,height=194]

. Migrate users.
+

Without leaving the Keycloak admin console, go to the realm (1) that was created via import. In the realm menu on the left, select *`Import`* (2) (when importing, select the *SKIP* strategy), then click *`Select file`* (3) and select the file from the following directory: _keycloak-export-<registry-name>-<realm-name>/<realm-name>-users-*.json_.
+
NOTE: If there are several files in this directory, import all of them.
+
image:admin:migrate-registry/migrate-registry-2.png[image,width=601,height=417]

. Create a registry via *`control-plane-console`*.

.. Create a registry with the same name and version on cluster B. When creating the registry, assign the same administrators as on cluster A and provide up-to-date information.
+
[NOTE]
====

Key info ::

You can provide valid keys for your registry or use test keys. After the migration, you can update the key data via the *Control Plane* admin console. To obtain the key data, contact an L2-L3 support team.
+

For details on updating registry keys, see xref:admin:registry-management/system-keys/control-plane-registry-keys.adoc[].

Registry template ::

Select the same template as used by the registry on cluster A. To find the template name, go to the *Openshift* console > *Projects* > *`control-plane`* > *API Explorer* > search for `codebase` > go to `codebase` > *Instances* > open `codebase <registry-name>` and check the following settings:
+
.codebase.yaml
=====
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    registry-parameters/template-name: templates/registry-tenant-template-minimal
----

In this case, *`templates/registry-tenant-template-minimal`* is the name of the registry deployment template.
=====
====
+

NOTE: If the console allows you to add DNS for Keycloak and user portals, skip this step, as traffic is still configured for cluster A.

.. Right after creating the registry, go to Jenkins (*`control-plane`* namespace > *Networking* > *Routes* > *`jenkins`*), and stop the first *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`* build.
+

NOTE: Wait until the `<registry-name>` directory and Jenkins pipeline are created. Immediately after the build starts, select *Abort*.


. Without leaving the Jenkins console, edit the *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`* configuration:
+
Go to *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`* > *Configure* > *Build Triggers*, select the *Disable this project* option, then click *Save*.

. Move the _values.yaml_ and _values.gotmpl_ configuration files from the registry's repository on cluster A to cluster B.

.. Go to the registry repository on cluster A:
+

... Go to *Control-plane-console* > *Dashboard* > *Gerrit*.
+
... In Gerrit, go to *Browse* > *Repositories* and open the `<registry-name>` repository.
+

... In the registry repository, go to *Branches* > `master`, switch to *deploy-templates*, and open the _values.yaml_ (_values.gotmpl_) file. Copy its raw code to the clipboard and save it in any text editor.

.. Go to the registry repository on cluster B:
+

... Go to *Control-plane-console* > *Dashboard* > *Gerrit*.
+
... In Gerrit, go to *Browse* > *Repositories* and open the `<registry-name>` repository.
+
... Go to *Commands* and click *`Create change`* to create a change with the following parameters:

** *Select branch for new change*: `master`.
** *Description*: `Update registry before migration`.
+

Once the change is created, click *`Edit`* > *`ADD/OPEN/UPLOAD`* and locate the _values.yaml_ (_values.gotmpl_) file.

Copy the configuration from the _values.yaml_ (_values.gotmpl_) file on cluster A that you saved earlier and paste it inside this file.

.. Do this for both files: _values.yaml_ and _values.gotmpl_.

.. Save your changes, wait until the *Code Review* (*СІ Jenkins `+1`*) pipeline completes, then apply *`Code-review +2`* and merge changes to the `master` branch using the `*Submit*` button.

. Check for `*CustomResourceDefintition*`.
+
[WARNING]
====

If no registries were deployed on cluster B previously, be sure to check for *`CustomResourceDefintition`*. To do this, log in to cluster B via *`oc cli`* and execute the following command:

----
oc get customresourcedefinition ingressclassparameterses.configuration.konghq.com
----

If this command ends with an error and returns a *`No resources found`* message in the console, go to the directory where the _migration.sh_ script is located and execute the following command from the root:

----
for file in $(ls crds); do oc apply -f crds/$file; done
----
====

== Restoring the registry on cluster B


. Go to Jenkins (*`control-plane`* namespace > *Networking* > *Routes* > *`jenkins`*) and open the folder with your registry name, then run the *Restore-registry-`<registry-name>`* pipeline. After starting the pipeline, select the version to restore at the `cleanup-registry-before-restore` stage, and wait until the process completes.

+

NOTE: If the process ends with an error or runs for more than 1-2 hours, contact an L2-L3 support team.

. After the pipeline completes, go to the Openshift console > *Projects* -> `<registry-name>` and ensure no pods have an error status.
+
[NOTE]
====

If the *`bpms-*`* pod is not running and has an error status, you must fix the passwords for the *`operational-instance`* and *`analytical-instance`* pods in `postgres`. To do this, perform these steps:

.. Go to *Openshift* console > *Secrets* and find the following secrets:
** *`operational-pguser-postgres`* secret for `operational-instance`
** *`analytical-pguser-postgres`* secret for `analytical-instance`

.. Open the secrets and copy the *password* field.

.. Go to *Openshift* console > *Pods* and find the *`operational-instance`* and *`analytical-instance`* pods. For each pod, execute the following commands successively:
+
[source,bash]
----
psql
----
+
[source,sql]
----
ALTER ROLE postgres WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
----
+
where *`<password>`* is the password you copied from the secret for each corresponding pod instance, `operational` and `analytical`.


.. After performing these steps, delete the *`bpms`* pod and wait until its status changes to *Running*.
====
+
[NOTE]
====

If the *`registry-rest-api`* pod returns an `ImagePullBackOff` error, add cluster B's IP to the *Openshift Route* > *Nexus* annotation.

To add the IP, go to *Openshift* console > *Projects* -> `<registry-name>` -> *Routes* > *Nexus* > *YAML* and check the following field in the _.yaml_ configuration:

.route.yaml
=====
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist: <NAT Cluster IP>/32,....
----
=====

If the IP address of cluster B is missing, add it to *`haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist`* with a *`/32`* mask.
====
+

. After ensuring all pods have a *Running* status, transfer the registry configuration to _values.yaml/values.gotmpl_.
+

.. Go to *_control-plane-gerrit_* (*Openshift* console > *Projects* > *`control-plane`* > *Networking* > *`gerrit`* > sign in via *`openshift-sso`*).
+

.. In Gerrit, go to *Browse* > *Repositories* and select the repository with your registry name.
+
.. Go to *Commands* and click *`Create change`* to create a change with the following parameters:

** *Select branch for new change*: `master`.
** *Description*: `Update registry before migration`.
+

.. Once the change is created, click *`Edit`*.

.. Add `vault` configuration to _values.gotmpl_.
+

To do this, take the current `vault` configuration from the *`hashicorp-vault-config`* config-map (*Openshift* console > *Projects* -> `<registry-name>` -> *Workloads* > *ConfigMaps* > *`hashicorp-vault-config`*) and copy the field as shown in the following example:
+
----
ui = true

listener "tcp" {
  tls_disable = 1
  address = "[::]:8200"
  cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
}
storage "file" {
  path = "/vault/data"
}
seal "transit" {
   address         = "https://<vault-url>"
   disable_renewal = "false"
   key_name        = "<key-name>"
   mount_path      = "transit/"
   tls_skip_verify = "true"
}
----
+

where *`<vault-url>`* is the link to the *`vault`* and *`<key-name>`* is the name of the key. The `config-map` contains up-to-date values.
+

.. Next, click *`ADD/OPEN/UPLOAD`* inside the change, search for _values.gotmpl_, and select the file. Inside the file, add the configuration as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
vault:
  platformVaultToken: {{ env "platformVaultToken" }}
  openshiftApiUrl: {{ env "openshiftApiUrl" }}
  centralVaultUrl: {{ b64dec $centralVaultUrl }}
  server:
    dataStorage:
      storageClass: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
    auditStorage:
      storageClass: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd

    standalone:
      config: |
       ui = true

       listener "tcp" {
         tls_disable = 1
         address = "[::]:8200"
         cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
       }
       storage "file" {
         path = "/vault/data"
       }
       seal "transit" {
          address         = "https://<vault-url>"
          disable_renewal = "false"
          key_name        = "<key-name>"
          mount_path      = "transit/"
          tls_skip_verify = "true"
       }
----

.. Click *`Save`*.

.. Resize `kafka` disks. Without leaving the template file, find the following field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
storage:
  zookeeper:
    size: 5Gi
  kafka:
    size: 20Gi
----
+


.. Modify the `kafka.size` value according to the current disk size in *Openshift* (*Openshift* console > *Projects* -> `<registry-name>` -> *Storage* > *`PersistentVolumeClaims`*). Search for *`data-0-kafka-cluster-kafka-0`* and find out its *`Capacity`*. Go back to _values.gotmpl_ and set the desired disk size. For example:
+
----
storage:
  zookeeper:
    size: 5Gi
  kafka:
    size: 40Gi
----
+

where 40Gi is the current disk size that matches `Capacity`.
+

.. Delete all *`GerritGroupMember`*. To do this, log in to cluster B via `os cli` and execute the following command:
+
----
oc -n <registry-name> delete gerritgroupmember --all
----
+

. After the changes are applied, the *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`* Jenkins process should start.

. After the *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`* Jenkins process completes, fix Jenkins credentials in the Jenkins registry.
+
[NOTE]
====

If you don't have access, add yourself as a registry administrator via *`control-plane-console`*.
====

.. To do this, go to *Openshift* console > *Projects* -> `<registry-name>` -> *Workloads* > *Secrets* > *`gerrit-control-plane-sshkey`* and copy the *id_rsa* field.
+

.. Then go to the registry Jenkins (*Networking* > *Routes* > `*jenkins*`) and open *Manage Jenkins* > *Manage Credentials*, find *`gerrit-ci-users-sshkey`* (*`gerrit-control-plane-sshkey`*), and click *`Update`*.
+

.. In the *Private Key* field, paste and *`Replace`* the *id_rsa* value you copied earlier.
+

. Update Nexus URL in the regulations repository.
+
To do this, go to *Openshift* console > *Projects* -> `<registry-name>` -> *Gerrit* and sign in to Gerrit.
+
Next, make sure you have access to projects in Gerrit and clone the *_registry-regulations_* repository locally. To do this, perform these steps:

.. In the Gerrit web interface, go to settings > *HTTP Credentials* and click `*Generate New Password*` to generate a new password. Save this password in any text editor.
+

.. Go to the *`registry-regulations`* repository and copy the contents of the *Clone with commit-msg hook* text box in the *Anonymous HTTP* tab.
+

.. Paste the repository clone command into the terminal and execute. The command will prompt you for a login and password. For the login, enter your email. For the password, paste the one you generated earlier in step A.
+
TIP: For details on working with Gerrit repositories, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/regulations-deploy/registry-admin-deploy-regulation.adoc[].
+
[NOTE]
====

If your Git user is different from your Gerrit user, execute the following commands:
----
git config --global user.name "New Author Name"
git config --global user.email "<email@address.example>"
----

For example:
----
git config --global user.name "Jonh Doe"
git config --global user.email "jong_doe@doemail.com"
----
====
+


. Change the minor version in _settings.yaml_ in the root directory of the *_registry-regulations_* repository, as shown in the following example:
+
----
settings:
  general:
    package: ua.gov.mdtu.ddm.dataplatform.template
    register: registry
    version: 2.21.0
----
For example, add `+1` to the version:
+
----
settings:
  general:
    package: ua.gov.mdtu.ddm.dataplatform.template
    register: registry
    version: 2.21.1
----
+

. Replace all mentions of cluster A DNS with cluster B. To do this, go to the *_registry-regulations/data-model_* directory in the terminal:
+
----
cd registry-regulations/data-model
----
+
Then execute the following command to replace DNS:
+
----
find "." \( -type d -name .git -prune \) -o -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e  's/<Cluster A DNS wildcard> /<Cluster B DNS Wildcard> /g'
----
+
[TIP]
====

`Cluster A DNS wildcard/Cluster B DNS wildcard` refers to *`apps.*`* (for example, `*apps.reestr1.eua.gov.ua*`).

Here is how a sed rule should look:
----
's/apps.cluster-a.dns.wildcard.com/apps.cluster-b.dns.wildcard.com/g'
----
====
+

. Commit and push changes to the repository:
+
[source,git]
----
git add --all
----
+
[source,git]
----
git commit -m "Update nexus URL"
----
+
[source,git]
----
git push origin refs/heads/master:refs/for/master
----
+

. Go to the registry Gerrit, apply *`Code-review +2`*, and merge changes to the `master` branch using the `*Submit*` button.
+

. After updating the master branch, go to the registry Jenkins and make sure the pipelines in the *registry-regulations* folder have been completed with a *Success* status.

== Testing the registry

. Make sure the user portals are working correctly and the business processes have migrated successfully.
+

. All Jenkins pipelines should complete with a *Success* status.

== Migrating the registry configuration

Migrate the registry configuration from cluster A to cluster B according to the following documentation: ::

* *Administrators* (for details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/create-users/create-registry-admins.adoc[]).
* *Key info*  (for details, see xref:admin:registry-management/system-keys/control-plane-registry-keys.adoc[]).
* *Mail server* (for details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/user-notifications/email/config-smtp-server.adoc[]).
* *Registry resources*
+
[NOTE]

Transfer registry configuration parameters (the `global.registry` section) from the _values.yaml_ file on cluster A to the _values.yaml_ file on cluster B.

* *DNS* (for details, see xref:admin:registry-management/custom-dns/custom-dns-overview.adoc[]).
* *Access restrictions* (for details, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-cidr-access-endpoints.adoc[]).
* *Service providers authentication* (for details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup/cp-auth-setup-officers.adoc[] and xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup/cp-officer-self-registration.adoc[]).
* *Service recipients authentication* (for details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup/cp-auth-setup-citizens.adoc[])
* *Backup* (for details, see xref:admin:backup-restore/control-plane-backup-restore.adoc[] and xref:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components.adoc[]).
