include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

When you deploy xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-create-registry.adoc[a registry instance], you must configure the digital signature key. After that, you can update key information as part of the registry editing. The configuration mechanism on the part of the administrator is the same both when initially adding and updating the key data.

To replace the digital key of the registry, follow the steps hereunder.

== Editing key data

. Log in to *Control Plane*, the administrative control panel of the registries, using the previously received login and password.
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/update-cluster-mgmt-01.png[]

. Go to the `Registries` section and select the corresponding registry in which you want to change the system key.
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/change-key/change-key-01.png[]

. Click the `Edit` button in the upper right corner.
+

== Setting keys

You can configure two types of keys:

* `file key`: stored in the user storage in the `*.dat` format.

* `hardware key`: stored in the network cryptomodule and controlled by the corresponding software.

=== Setting the file keys

. Select `Storage type` -- `File-based key storage` (default).
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/change-key/change-key-04.png[]

. Press the kbd:[Select file] button to add the new system key. In the new window, navigate to the folder where the key file in the `*.dat` format is stored, select it, and click kbd:[Open].
+
[NOTE]
====
Accredited key certification centers (AKCC) are state-accredited organizations that provide digital signature services, secure key information carriers, or use the applicant’s carriers like USB flash drives. They play a vital role in maintaining the security and integrity of digital transactions and communications, ensuring the authenticity of digital signatures, and thus enabling secure and trustworthy electronic interactions.
====
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/change-key/change-key-05.png[]

. The following step is to enter the name of the Accredited key certification center (AKCC) in the `AKCC that issued the key` field. The name of the AKCC that issued the key can be found in the certificate of the key.

. Enter the password of the selected system key into the corresponding field.
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/change-key/change-key-06.png[]

. Enter the list of certificates from the appropriate key certification centers (_.p7b_). You can get your _.p7b_ file on the site of your regional competent authority.
+
[NOTE]
====
When deploying and working with the test registry, use the certificates of the test AKCC, otherwise the registry deployment pipeline will not work, and you will receive the `digital-signature-ops` cryptoservice initialization error. This happens because the certificate files for the production environment simply do not contain data about the test AKCC.

include::ROOT:partial$admonitions/ua-specific.adoc[]

For the prod environment, use the appropriate prod certificates.

* AKCC certificates for the test environment: https://iit.com.ua/download/productfiles/CACertificates.Test.All.p7b[].

* AKCC certificates for the prod environment: https://iit.com.ua/download/productfiles/CACertificates.p7b[].

====
+
Add the certificate file by clicking the kbd:[Select File] button in the `AKCC public certificates (.p7b extension)` field. In the new window, navigate to the folder where the certificate file is stored, select it, and click kbd:[Open].

. Next, indicate the `List of allowed keys` whose signature can be considered true.
+
[NOTE]
This block specifies a list of keys, including the old ones _(for example, when replacing keys)_, so that everything previously signed with the old key is verified (validated). That is, the list of allowed keys must contain the data history of all keys used in the system for signing.
+
The list of allowed keys contains the following key data:

* `"Key issuer"`
* `"Key serial number"`

== Confirming changes and applying configuration

Platform keys are updated by changing the configuration of the Digital signature service.

=== Digital signature key configuration algorithm

The general configuration algorithm is as follows for Platform and registry keys: ::

* The administrator edits the Platform or registry's digital signature keys in the Control Plane administrative interface.

* The Control Plane web interface stores changes made by the administrator to the HashiCorp Vault service of the Secret and encryption management subsystem or to the Gerrit service of the Platform and registries deployment and configuration subsystem.

* The Control Plane web interface displays the path to values and files in the corresponding _values.yaml_ configurations.

* The pipeline takes the required data from HashiCorp Vault or Gerrit and creates the necessary secrets in OpenShift.

Below is the diagram for updating the Platform and registry's keys and the configuration of the digital signature service.

.Updating platform and registry keys and digital signature service configuration

image::arch:architecture/platform/administrative/config-management/keys-update-config.svg[registry-platform-keys]

=== Configuration and secret creation parameters

The Control Plane administration panel stores the following data in the vault for the Digital signatures service (DSS):

* AKCC list

* `KeySecretData`
* `CASecretData`
* `AllowedKeysSecretData`
* `osplm.ini`
* Data of the DSS environment variables

The path to the engine for the Platform keys looks as follows:

----
registry-kv/registry/<назва-реєстру>/key-management/
----

Parameters and paths are added to the *_deploy-templates/values.yaml_* registry configuration.

[#confirm-changes]
=== Confirming changes and launching the pipeline

As a result of updating the key data on the Control Plane interface, a new request is created to update the registry configuration, which you have to confirm.

. In the Control Plane admin panel interface, return to the [.underline]#Platform management# section, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and find the *Update Requests* section.
+
image:registry-management/cp-submit-mr/cp-submit-mr-1.png[]

. Open the generated request by clicking the view icon: 👁.
+
NOTE: The suggested changes are made to the _deploy-templates/values.yaml_ file configuration when confirmed.

. In the new window, compare 2 versions of the changes, ensuring the data you entered is correct, and click kbd:[Confirm].
+

image::admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/change-key/change-key-39.png[]
+
image:registry-management/cp-submit-mr/cp-submit-mr-3.png[]
+
As a result, the request becomes `Confirmed` and the changes take effect.

+
image:registry-management/cp-submit-mr/cp-submit-mr-4.png[]
+
Next, the *`MASTER-Build-<registry-name>`* pipeline automatically starts, which applies the parameters of the specified configuration and creates secrets for the digital signature keys.

. Wait while the code is compiled. This may take about 15 minutes, but this time depends on the configuration of a particular registry.
+
You can check the current status and the result of the execution using the *`CI`* link on the interface.
