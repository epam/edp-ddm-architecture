== Functionality description

The Control Plane admin panel offers a user-friendly interface, allowing administrators to manage restrictions on uploading digital documents to the registry by users and business processes.

*Maximum file upload size (MB)*: This field allows setting the maximum size of an individual file that can be uploaded.

NOTE: The value is entered in megabytes (MB) and can consist of numbers (`0-9`) and a dot. The maximum length of the value is four characters. For example, values can be set as `10`, `100`, `50.2`, etc. It should be less than or equal to the global restriction at the Platform level, which is `100` MB for the maximum request size.

*Maximum total size for a group of files upload (MB)*: This field allows setting the maximum cumulative size for a group of files that can be uploaded simultaneously.

NOTE: This value is also entered in megabytes (MB) and can consist of numbers (`0-9`) and a dot, with a maximum value length of 4 characters. For example, values can be set as `10`, `100`, `50.2`, etc. It should be less than or equal to the global restriction at the Platform level, which is `100` MB for the maximum request size.

Applying changes and configuration deployment ::

. Set your restrictions or leave the default values.

. Click *`Confirm`* to save the changes to the configuration.

. As a result, the system generates an update request with a status of `New` and a type of `Registry Edit`.

. Find the necessary request in the section *Registries* > *Update requests*.
+

. Open the generated request by clicking on the view icon -- üëÅ.

. In the new window, compare the two versions of changes, ensure the data you entered is correct, and click *`Confirm`*. You can also directly reject the changes to the configuration by clicking *`Reject`*.
+
NOTE: After confirmation, proposed changes are made to the configuration file *_deploy-templates/values.yaml_* in the registry repository.
+
The changes are saved to the configuration in the following format:
+
[source,yaml]
.Example 1. Setting the maximum digital document upload size in deploy-templates/values.yaml
----
digitalDocuments:
    maxFileSize: 100MB
    maxTotalFileSize: 100MB
----
+
As a result, the request obtains the status `Confirmed`.

. Deploying changes takes some time and is automatically performed by the Jenkins service. The service starts a process (pipeline) named *Master-Build-`<registry-name>`*, where `<registry-name>` is the registry name. You can check the deployment status by navigating to the section *Registries* > your registry > *Configuration* > *CI*.
