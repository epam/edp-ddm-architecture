= Deploying a registry
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

After successfully xref:installation/platform-deployment/platform-deployment-overview.adoc[deploying the Platform on a target environment], a Platform administrator can access the *Control Plane* admin console interface. In Control Plane, you can manage the configurations of the Platform infrastructure components (`cluster-mgmt`) and registry components.

[TIP]
====
You can find the link to *Control Plane* in the OpenShift console. Go to *Networking* > *Routes* and search for `control-plane`. The link is displayed in the *Location* column of search results.

====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only a Platform administrator with appropriate permissions can deploy a registry using the *Control Plane* admin console. This action requires a `cp-cluster-mgmt-admin` role in Keycloak's `control-plane-admin` realm.

For details, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-assign-platform-admins.adoc[].
====

To deploy a new registry, perform these steps: ::
+
. Sign in to *Control Plane*.
+
image:admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/update-cluster-mgmt-01.png[]

. Open the *Registries* section and click the *`Create New`* button.
+
image:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/cp-registry-deploy-1.png[]

. Configure your registry parameters.
+
TIP: Read on for details on each deployment step.

[#general-settings]
== General settings

In this step, you can specify the registry's system name, which is used in various data exchange operations on the Platform. The registry name cannot be changed once the registry is created.

[CAUTION]
====
* The *Registry name* is a required field.
* The name must be unique.
* Allowed characters are lowercase Latin letters (`a-z`) and hyphens (`-`).
* The name cannot contain more than 12 characters.
====

You can describe the purpose of the registry or provide its official name in the *Description* field. This information may be helpful for business or legal reasons.

Click *`Confirm`* to go to the next step.

== Creating registry administrators

In this step, you can assign registry administrators.

[NOTE]
====
You can also add administrators by editing the registry soon after its deployment.

For details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/create-users/create-registry-admins.adoc[].
====

. In the *Administrators* field, specify the administrators who will have access to the registry.
+
CAUTION: This is a required field. It means at least ONE admin must be added here.
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-2-1.png[]
+
Click the *`+`* (*Add*) button and provide the following details for each registry administrator:
+
--
* *First name*
* *Last name*
* *Email address*
* *Temporary password*
--
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-2.png[]

+
To add several administrators, repeat this step for each user separately (click *`+`* > provide details > *`Confirm`*).
+
[NOTE]
====
Use a lower case for email addresses.

Allowed characters are: digits (`0-9`), Latin letters (`a-z`), underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), at sign (`@`), dots (`.`), and commas (`,`).
====

. Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-2-2.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====
The registry administrator account is automatically created in the `openshift` realm of the *Keycloak* service with the `cp-registry-admin-<registry-name>` role in the `/cp-registry-admin-<registry-name>` group, where `<registry-name>` is the name of your registry.
====

== Registry deployment template

In this step, you can select a template for your registry. Templates are predefined registry configurations with a set number of resources that you can select depending on the expected workload. For example, you can choose between a minimum and recommended configuration, or select a configuration with GeoServer, and so on.

TIP: To calculate the approximate cost of the resources your registry will need, use the xref:arch:architecture/platform-system-requirements/registry-cost.adoc[] page or reach out to the Platform's technical support team.

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-3.png[]

. Select the configuration template for your registry from the *Registry template* list.
+
A registry template defines the configuration options and the allocated resources, including *CPU*, *RAM*, the number of nodes in *MachineSets*, and so on.
+
CAUTION: This is a required field.
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-3-1.png[]

. In the *Registry template branch* field, select the branch to use when deploying your registry.
+
NOTE: This refers to the version of the component's branch in the Gerrit repository containing the corresponding registry template version.
+
CAUTION: This is a required field.
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-3-2.png[]

. Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-3-3.png[]

== Mail server settings

In this step, you can select the type of mail server your registry will use for sending email messages.

CAUTION: The step is optional. You can skip it when creating a registry and return to these settings when editing it.

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-4.png[]

* *Platform mail server* (`platform-mail-server`) is a mail server distributed as part of the Platform. This service is available to all registries within a single instance of the Platform.

* *External mail server* (`external-mail-server`) is a mail server outside the Platform (such as *Gmail*).

[TIP]
====
For details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/user-notifications/email/config-smtp-server.adoc[].
====

Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.

== Information about keys

In this step, you can configure your registry's digital signature keys and certificates. Once the registry is created, you will be able to update these settings by editing your registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This step is mandatory.

Data in the *Key info* section is required to initialize the `digital-signature-ops` crypto service and apply the system signature, or system digital seal. Without this information, the crypto service will not start.

Encryption keys are used to sign excerpts generated by the Platform and to sign data that is modified according to the logic of the registry's business processes.
====

[TIP]
====
For details on configuring keys, see xref:registry-management/system-keys/control-plane-registry-keys.adoc[].
====

. In the *Media type* field, select the type of key to use.

. Provide the electronic key.
+
Upload the Platform administrator's operational key file (_Key-6.dat_) using the *File key (.dat)* field. Click kbd:[*Browse*], locate the key file on your computer, select it, and click kbd:[Open].

. The *AKCC that issued the key* field displays the full name of the AKCC (Accredited Key Certification Center).

. In the *File key password* field, enter the password for the key you uploaded.

. The *Key validation info* section contains public certificates data and a list of AKCCs:

* Upload the https://iit.com.ua/download/productfiles/CACertificates.p7b[CACertificates.p7b] file that contains a list of certificates of compatible AKCCs using the *Public AKCC certificates (.p7b)* field. You can download this file from the IIT website: https://iit.com.ua/downloads.

* Upload the https://iit.com.ua/download/productfiles/[CAs.json] file that contains interaction parameters for compatible AKCCs using the *AKCCs list (.json)* field. You can download this file from the IIT website: https://iit.com.ua/downloads.

. In the *Allowed keys list*, specify the keys whose signatures are considered valid.
+
[NOTE]
====
This section contains a list of all keys, including old ones (for example, when rotating keys), so that everything previously signed with an old key is still considered validated. That is, the list of allowed keys should contain the data history of all the keys used in the system to apply a signature.
====

. Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-5.png[]

== Registry resources

In this step, you can configure registry resources for specific services that are deployed in it. Properly managing the resources used by containers within your registry instance ensures optimal performance and efficiency.

. Select the service you wish to configure from the list and click *`+`* (*Add*).
+
[CAUTION]
====
This step is optional.

When the registry is deployed, all its services are configured using the default values for requests, limits, and environment variables.

Even if services are removed from the list, the Platform will apply the standard configuration when deploying the registry.
====
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-7.png[]

. Customize resource parameters.

. Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-7-1.png[]

TIP: For details on configuring the resources, see xref:registry-management/control-plane-registry-resources.adoc[].

== DNS settings

In this step, you can set custom DNS names and upload SSL certificates in `.pem` format for the Keycloak service and user portals.

[CAUTION]
====
This step is optional.

If you do not configure anything here, the system will use the default values.
====

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-6.png[]

TIP: For details on configuring DNS, see xref:admin:registry-management/custom-dns/custom-dns-overview.adoc[].

Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.

== Access restrictions

In this step, you can restrict access to specific registry components, such as user portals and administrative components.

[CAUTION]
====
This step is optional, but we recommend configuring CIDR for these components for security purposes.
====

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-8.png[]

TIP: For details, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-cidr-access-endpoints.adoc[].

Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.

== Officers (service providers) authentication

In this step, you can configure authentication for service providers (officers) and enable or disable self-registration.

[CAUTION]
====
This step is optional.

If you do not configure anything here, the system will use the default values: authentication using Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) and disabled self-registration.
====

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-9.png[]

Select the authentication type to use when identifying users in the system:

--
* QES -- a widget to authenticate users via Qualified electronic signatures.
* *id.gov.ua* -- a widget to authenticate users via third-party digital identification providers.
--

include::ROOT:partial$admonitions/ua-specific.adoc[]

TIP: For details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup/cp-auth-setup-officers.adoc[].

You can enable the self-registration option for officers to simplify the user registration process by removing the need to involve an administrator.

TIP: For details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup/cp-officer-self-registration.adoc[].

Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.

== Citizens (service recipients) authentication

include::ROOT:partial$admonitions/ua-specific.adoc[]

In this step, you can set up validation to check whether business users have an active entry in the Unified state register (EDR). This allows the system to connect the user's QES with their legal records in the state register. This is an important aspect of the system's security and reliability that helps validate user data and confirm their identity.

[CAUTION]
====
This step is optional.

If you do not configure anything here, the system will use the default value: validation disabled.
====

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-10.png[]

Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.

== Backup settings

In this step, you can set the backup schedule for your registry components and define the retention period for backup copies in the backup repository.

Component backup copies are created using the *Velero* tool and stored in the *MinIO* secure backup storage outside the Platform cluster.

The backup schedule is configured using the https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[*unix-cron*] format in the *Control Plane* admin console interface.

The system also performs automatic replication of data stored in S3 buckets. You can configure a backup schedule for these replications.

image:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components/backup-schedule-registry-components-8-1.png[]

[TIP]
====
* To learn about creating registry backups _automatically_ and configuring backups for S3 bucket replications, see xref:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components.adoc[].
* To learn about creating backups _manually_ and restoring the registry environment from them, see xref:admin:backup-restore/control-plane-backup-restore.adoc[].
====

Click *`Next`* to go to the next step.

== Confirmation and deployment

To complete the procedure, click the *Create registry* button.

You can go back to any of the settings tabs to double-check the data you provided.

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-12.png[]

As a result, the registry appears in the *Registries* section of the *Control Plane* admin console interface.

If the registry is deployed successfully, a green check mark appears next to its name in the *Status* column.

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-12-2.png[]

Deploying the registry takes some time. The Jenkins service starts the deployment automatically by running the pipeline called *Master-Build-`<registry-name>`*, where `<registry-name>` is the name of your registry. To monitor the deployment process, go to the *Registries* section and open the registry you just created, then scroll down to the *Configuration* section and click the *Jenkins* link icon in the *CI* column.
