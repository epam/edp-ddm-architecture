= Configuring custom DNS for Keycloak

== Introduction

Platform administrators can configure custom DNS names for the Keycloak user and role management service using the Control Plane admin console.

Why you should use this feature: ::

* Custom DNS names enable you to create convenient and easy-to-remember URLs for users to sign in to the user portals.

* This setup ensures proper certificate validation and authentication via Keycloak for correct service-to-service interactions on private networks.


This provides administrators with a simple and efficient way to manage Keycloak settings, making it easier to work with the system.

Functional scenarios: ::

* Configuring DNS names for Keycloak via the admin console at the Platform level.

* Setting a DNS name for the user portal sign-in pages via the admin console at the registry level.

* Removing DNS names added to Keycloak.

General principles and provisions: ::


* The Platform administrator configures available DNS names for Keycloak.


* The Platform administrator uploads the SSL certificate file in the *_.pem_* format for the domain along with the DNS name.

* The registry administrator configures DNS names for the registry user portals.

* The registry administrator selects a domain for Keycloak from a list.

* The list of domains available in the system comes from the Platform's Keycloak DNS names.

* Individual SSL certificates in the *_.pem_* format can be downloaded for each user portal in portal settings.

* The Platform administrator ensures certificate rotation for Keycloak and user portals.

* The system allows editing previously installed SSL certificates and DNS names.

* The admin console checks whether the provided SSL certificate matches the domain, is not self-signed, and has not expired.

* For security reasons, access to the _HashiCorp Vault_ to read certificates works ONLY through a separate service (system) account.

* If the registry is deployed without user portals (officer portal or citizen portal), the corresponding UI elements for configuring DNS names are hidden.

* The URL for Keycloak and user portals is limited to 63 characters and must be validated by the system.

== Configuring DNS names for the Platform's Keycloak component


To configure custom DNS names and upload SSL certificates for Keycloak, follow these steps:

. Sign in to the *Control Plane* admin console.

. Go to *Platform management* and open the *Keycloak DNS* section.
+

This section displays the system's default DNS value that cannot be edited.
+

NOTE: For additional DNS names, configure your DNS records on your DNS provider side. For details, jump to xref:#external-configuration[].
+
image:registry-management/custom-dns/keycloak/custom-dns-keycloak-platform-1.png[]

. Click the *Add DNS* button.
. In the *Add DNS* window, enter the domain name for Keycloak into the *Keycloak domain name* field and upload Keycloak certificate using the *Upload SSL certificate* button.
+

NOTE: The admin console gets the default DNS configuration from the Keycloak CR (Custom Resource) specification in the *`user-management`* component.

. In the *Add DNS* window, click the *Confirm* button to save your settings and start the validation checks.
+

TIP: To close the window without saving your changes, click *Cancel*.
+
image:registry-management/custom-dns/keycloak/custom-dns-keycloak-platform-2.png[]
+

The *Keycloak DNS* page lists all the DNS records you added.

. To edit additional DNS records, click the pencil icon next to one of the additional DNS records. Change the domain name and certificate in the editing window.
+

NOTE: *Cancel* and *Confirm* buttons work the same as when adding a new DNS record. The same validation happens when you save the settings.

. You can remove an additional DNS record if it is not used by any of the registries. To delete a DNS record, click the recycle bin icon next to it and confirm your action in a window that opens.
+
NOTE: If an additional DNS name is used by any registry, you need to first change this domain in the corresponding registry settings to something else.

. When you are finished working with additional DNS, click *Confirm* to save your changes. The changes are saved once the system validates them.

+

As a result, the system generates a registry configuration update request. You can view request details in the *Platform management* > *Update requests* section.

. Confirm the changes and wait until the *MASTER-Build-cluster-mgmt* Jenkins process completes and applies the new configuration.

[#configure-dns-registry]

== Configuring DNS names for the registryâ€™s Keycloak component


DNS names configured as described in xref:#configure-dns-platform[] can be used when creating or editing a registry.

. Sign in to the *Control Plane* admin console.

. Open the `Registries` section and select the registry you wish to edit.

. On the registry information page, click the `Edit` button in the upper-right corner.
. On the registry edit page, open the *DNS* section.

. Under *User and role management service (Keycloak)*, select the DNS name from the *Keycloak domain name* list.

. Click *Confirm* to save your changes. The changes are saved once the system validates them.

+
As a result, the system generates a registry configuration update request. You can view request details in the *Registries* > *Update requests* section.

. Confirm the changes and wait until the *MASTER-Build-<registry-name>* Jenkins process completes and applies the new configuration.

[#external-configuration]
== Additional configuration outside the OpenShift cluster and registry


Perform additional configuration outside the OpenShift cluster and registry.

. Create a `CNAME` record with your DNS provider.
+
This record should point to the _Load Balancer_ bound to the OpenShift router (_HAProxy_). An OpenShift router domain is different for each cluster. `CNAME` records must always point to another domain name, not an IP address.
+
[TIP]
====

A `CNAME` (Canonical Name) record is a type of DNS record that maps a domain name (alias) to a true or canonical domain name.
====
+
Here is an example of a `CNAME` record:
+
----
www.example.net. CNAME www.example.com.
----
+
You can view the current CNAME records using the link:https://dns.google[Google Public DNS] service.
+
[WARNING]
====

A `CNAME` record cannot be set for *apex* domains (such as example.com); a subdomain must be specified (such as www.example.com).
====

. Please contact the _technical administrator's support service of the Platform instance_ through your channel and submit a request to add a new address to the test https://eu.iit.com.ua/[eu.iit.com.ua] widget.
+

--
The Keycloak's new DNS name becomes available after the external configuration takes effect.

[CAUTION]

Typically, DNS names are updated within one hour, although a global update can take up to 48 hours but in exceptional cases can last up to 72 hours.

== Applying configuration changes


When you confirm the changes in the admin console, the following happens at the Platform and registry levels.


Platform settings: ::

. The SSL certificates you uploaded for custom Keycloak domains are saved to the *HashiCorp Vault* secrets and encryption management subsystem.

. Domain records and SSL certificate paths are added to the *_deploy-templates/values.yaml_* file of the `*cluster-mgmt*` component. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
keycloak:
  customHosts:
    - host: keycloak.example.com
      certificatePath: registry-kv/....
    - host: keycloak-login.instance.com
      certificatePath: registry-kv/....
----


Registry settings: ::

. The SSL certificates you uploaded for custom user portal domains are saved to *HashiCorp Vault*.

. Domain records and SSL certificate paths are added to the *_deploy-templates/values.yaml_* file in the corresponding registry repository. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
portals:
  officer:
    customHost:
       enabled: true
       host: officer.example.com
       certificatePath: registry-kv/....
----

[ssl-certificates-saving-convention]

=== SSL certificate storage convention

HashiCorp Vault's SSL certificate storage convention defines the paths for Platform and registry certificates.

Platform certificates are saved to:

----
registry-kv/cluster/domains/<domain-name>

key:caCertificate value:<caValue>
key:certificate value:<certificateValue>
key:key value:<keyValue>
----


Registry certificates are saved to:

----
registry-kv/registry/<registry-name>/domains/<portal-name>/<domain-name>

key:caCertificate value:<caValue>
key:certificate value:<certificateValue>
key:key value:<keyValue>
----
