        ### Endpoint purpose:
        This endpoint is used for retrieving a JSON representation of a __i18n bundle__ directly from the __master__ version. This operation retrieves a single _i18n bundle_ based on the specified __name__. If you need to retrieve list of _i18n bundles_, you can use the [GET](#master-version-i18n-api/getI18nListFromMaster) endpoint.

      summary: Update existing i18n bundle within master version.
      description: |-
        ### Endpoint purpose:
        This endpoint is used for updating a json representation of a __i18n bundle__ directly in __master__ version. Just as if _version-candidate_ was created, the _i18n bundle_ was updated in that _version-candidate_ and then the _version-candidate_ was submitted. It can be used if there is needed to update __a single i18n bundle__. If you need to make some changes in several entities at one time, it's still preferred to make this changes through a _version-candidate_.
        ### Conflict resolving:
        In this endpoint [Conditional requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-conditional-requests) are supported. You can use an __ETag__ header value, that can be previously obtained in [GET](#master-version-i18n-api/getI18n) request, as a value for __If-Match__ header so you can be sure that you're updating the last version of an _i18n bundle_. But if your __If-Match__ value is differs from the servers you will receive a _409 Conflict_ instead of _412 Precondition Failed_. For _registry-regulation-management_ service this situation's considered as a conflict. If __If-Match__ is not present then conflict checking won't be performed.
        ### I18n bundle validation:
        Before saving the content to the storage, the __validation__ of a _i18n bundle_ is executed. The _i18n bundle_ must be a __json__ document
         ### Missing i18n bundle handling:
         If the updated _i18n bundle_ is missing and the _If-Match_ header is not present (or equal to __"*"__) then the _i18n bundle_ will be __created__ instead.

      description: |-
        ### Endpoint purpose:
        This endpoint is used for creating a JSON representation of a __i18n bundle__ directly in the __master__ version. It is intended for situations that require the creation of a new _i18n bundle_. This operation creates a single _i18n bundle_ and should be used when multiple resources do not need to be created or modified simultaneously. If you need to create or modify several resources at once, it is still recommended to use a _version-candidate_.
        ### I18n bundle validation:
        Before saving the new _i18n bundle_ to the storage, the server validates the _i18n bundle_. The _i18n bundle_ must be a valid __json__ document
        ### Missing i18n bundle handling:
        If the specified _i18n bundle_ does not already exist, the server will create a new _i18n bundle_ with the provided data. If the _i18n bundle_ does exists, the server will return a _409 Conflict_ error indicating that the _i18n bundle_ already exists.

        \ In this endpoint [Conditional requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-conditional-requests)\
        \ are supported. You can use an __ETag__ header value, that can be previously\

        \ for __If-Match__ header so you can be sure that you're updating the last\

        \ be performed.\n### Form validation: \nBefore saving the content to the storage,\
        \ the __validation__ of a _form_ is executed. The _form_ must be a __json__\
        \ document and must have a non-empty __\"title\"__ field. Also the field __\"\
        name\"__ must be present and equal to __\"path\"__ field, that must be present\
        \ too. Also _both_ this values must be equal to __\"formName\"__ pathVariable.\
        \ In other case the _form_ won't be working as expected. Changing __\"name\"\
        __ or __\"path\"__ is not supported. If you need to change these fields then\
        \ you need to copy the _form_ with new name and delete the previous _form_.\

        \ _If-Match_ header is not present (or equal to __\"*\"__) then the _form_\
        \ will be __created__ instead.\n ### Created and modified dates handling:\n\
        \ If there any of __\"created\"__ or __\"modified\"__ fields present in the\
        \ request body they will be ignored. Value for the __\"created\"__ field is\
        \ automatically getting from the previous _form_ content (if present, in other\
        \ case it's getting from the git log). And for the __\"updated\"__ value the\
        \ current servers datetime in UTC is set."

      description: "### Endpoint purpose: \n This endpoint is used for creating a\
        \ JSON representation of a user __form__ directly in the __master__ version.\
        \ It is intended for situations that require the creation of a new _form_.\
        \ This operation creates a single _form_ and should be used when multiple\
        \ _forms_ and/or _business-processes_ do not need to be created or modified\
        \ simultaneously. If you need to create or modify several _forms_ and/or _business-processes_\
        \ at once, it is still recommended to use a _version-candidate_. \n ### Form\
        \ validation: \nBefore saving the new _form_ to the storage, the server validates\
        \ the _form_. The _form_ must be a __json__ document and must have a non-empty\
        \ __\"title\"__ field. Also the field __\"name\"__ must be present and equal\
        \ to __\"path\"__ field, that must be present too. Also _both_ this values\
        \ must be equal to __\"formName\"__ pathVariable. In other case the _form_\
        \ won't be working as expected. \n ### Missing form handling: \n If the specified\
        \ _form_ does not already exist, the server will create a new _form_ with\
        \ the provided data. If the _form_ does exists, the server will return a _409\
        \ Conflict_ error indicating that the _form_ already exists.\n ### Created\
        \ and modified dates handling:\n If there any of __\"created\"__ or __\"modified\"\
        __ fields present in the request body they will be ignored. The __\"created\"\
        __ and __\"updated\"__ fields are automatically set to the current server\
        \ time in UTC."

        ### Endpoint purpose:
         This endpoint is used for deleting a JSON representation of a user __form__ directly from the __master__ version.
        ### Conflict resolving:
         In this endpoint, [Conditional requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-conditional-requests) are supported. You can use an __ETag__ header value, which can be previously obtained in a [GET](#master-version-forms-api/getForm) request, as a value for the __If-Match__ header. This ensures that you're deleting the latest version of the _form_. However, if your __If-Match__ value differs from the server's value, you will receive _409 Conflict_ instead of _412 Precondition Failed_. For the _registry-regulation-management_ service, this situation is considered a conflict. If the __If-Match__ header is not present, conflict checking will not be performed.
         ### Missing form handling:
         If the specified _form_ is missing and the _If-Match_ header is not present (or equal to __"*"__), the server will return a 404 Not Found error indicating that the specified _form_ does not exist.

      description: "### Endpoint purpose: \n This endpoint is used for creating a\
        \ xml representation of a user __business process__ directly in __master__\
        \ version. Just as if _version-candidate_ was created, the _business process_\
        \ was created in that _version-candidate_ and then the _version-candidate_\
        \ was submitted. It can be used if there is needed to create __a single business\
        \ process__. If you need to create several _business processes_ at one time,\
        \ it's still preferred to make this changes through a _version-candidate_.\
        \ \n ### Business process validation: \nBefore saving the content to the storage,\
        \ the __validation__ of a _business-process_ is executed. The _business-process_\
        \ must be a __xml__ document, must conform to the BPMN20.xsd schema (available\
        \ at https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-moddle/blob/master/resources/bpmn/xsd/BPMN20.xsd)\
        \ and must have a non-empty __\"name\"__ field (attribute as part of tCallableElement).\
        \ Also _name_ values must be equal to __\"businessProcessName\"__ pathVariable.\
        \ In other case the _business-process_ won't be working as expected. \n###\
        \ Missing business process handling: \n If the specified _business-process_\
        \ does not already exist, the server will create a new _business-process_\
        \ with the provided data. Otherwise, the server will return a _409 Conflict_\
        \ error indicating that the _business-process_ already exists."

        ### Endpoint purpose:
         This endpoint is used for deleting a user __business-process__ directly from the __master__ version.
        ### Conflict resolving:
         In this endpoint, [Conditional requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-conditional-requests) are supported. You can use an __ETag__ header value, which can be previously obtained in a [GET](#master-version-business-processes-api/getBusinessProcess) request, as a value for the __If-Match__ header. This ensures that you're deleting the latest version of the _business process_. However, if your __If-Match__ value differs from the server's value, you will receive _409 Conflict_ instead of _412 Precondition Failed_. For the _registry-regulation-management_ service, this situation is considered a conflict. If the __If-Match__ header is not present, conflict checking will not be performed.
         ### Missing business process handling:
         If the specified _business process_ is missing and the _If-Match_ header is not present (or equal to __"*"__), the server will return a 404 Not Found error indicating that the specified _business process_ does not exist.

      summary: Update existing i18n bundle within version-candidate
      description: |-
        ### Endpoint purpose:
        This endpoint is used for updating a json representation of a __i18n bundle__ in __version-candidate__.
        ### Conflict resolving:
        In this endpoint [Conditional requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-conditional-requests) are supported. You can use an __ETag__ header value, that can be previously obtained in [GET](#candidate-version-i18n-api/getI18n) request, as a value for __If-Match__ header so you can be sure that you're updating the last version of a _i18n bundle_. But if your __If-Match__ value is differs from the servers you will receive a _409 Conflict_ instead of _412 Precondition Failed_. For _registry-regulation-management_ service this situation's considered as a conflict. If __If-Match__ is not present then conflict checking won't be performed.
        ### I18n bundle validation:
        Before saving the content to the storage, the __validation__ of a _i18n bundle_ is executed. The _i18n bundle_ must be a __json__ document.
        ### Missing i18n bundle handling:
        If the updated _i18n bundle_ is missing and the _If-Match_ header is not present (or equal to __"*"__) then the _i18n bundle_ will be __created__ instead.

        ### Endpoint purpose:
         This endpoint is used for deleting a JSON representation of a user __form__ from the __version-candidate__.
        ### Conflict resolving:
         In this endpoint, [Conditional requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-conditional-requests) are supported. You can use an __ETag__ header value, which can be previously obtained in a [GET](#candidate-version-forms-api/getForm) request, as a value for the __If-Match__ header. This ensures that you're deleting the latest version of the _form_. However, if your __If-Match__ value differs from the server's value, you will receive _409 Conflict_ instead of _412 Precondition Failed_. For the _registry-regulation-management_ service, this situation is considered a conflict. If the __If-Match__ header is not present, conflict checking will not be performed.
        ### Missing form handling:
        If the specified _form_ is missing and the _If-Match_ header is not present (or equal to __"*"__), the server will return a 404 Not Found error indicating that the specified _form_ does not exist.

        ### Endpoint purpose:
         This endpoint is used for updating a XML representation of the _content of the data-model tables_ file from the _version-candidate_. A conflict can arise when two or more commits have made changes to the same part of a file. This can happen when two developers are working on the same branch at the same time, and both make changes to the same piece of code without being aware of each other's changes. In this situation, the system cannot automatically determine which change is the correct one, and will require human intervention to resolve the conflict.

        \ obtained in [GET](#candidate-version-business-processes-api/getBusinessProcess)\
        \ request, as a value for __If-Match__ header so you can be sure that you're\

        \ and must have a non-empty __\"name\"__ field (attribute as part of tCallableElement).\
        \ Also _name_ values must be equal to __\"businessProcessName\"__ pathVariable.\

        ### Endpoint purpose:
         This endpoint is used for deleting a user __business-process__ from the __version-candidate__.
        ### Conflict resolving:
         In this endpoint, [Conditional requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-conditional-requests) are supported. You can use an __ETag__ header value, which can be previously obtained in a [GET](#candidate-version-business-processes-api/getBusinessProcess) request, as a value for the __If-Match__ header. This ensures that you're deleting the latest version of the _business process_. However, if your __If-Match__ value differs from the server's value, you will receive _409 Conflict_ instead of _412 Precondition Failed_. For the _registry-regulation-management_ service, this situation is considered a conflict. If the __If-Match__ header is not present, conflict checking will not be performed.
         ### Missing business process handling:
         If the specified _business process_ is missing and the _If-Match_ header is not present (or equal to __"*"__), the server will return a 404 Not Found error indicating that the specified _business process_ does not exist.

      summary: Create new version-candidate from current state of master version.
      description: |-
        ### Endpoint purpose:
          This endpoint is used to create a new __version-candidate__ from the current state of the _master_ version. The purpose is to allow making changes to the data elements without affecting the stability of the _master_ version. The endpoint requires the `X-Access-Token` header for security. Once the new __version-candidate__ is created, it can be developed independently from other __version-candidates__ or the _master_ version. When the changes are ready, the __version-candidate__ can be merged back into the _master_ version. If the operation is _successful_, the resulting `VersionInfoDetailed` object is returned along with a _`201 Created`_ status code. If the request _fails_ due to invalid input or server issues, a _`4xx` or `5xx`_ HTTP response code may be returned along with a detailed error message.

      description: |-
        ### Endpoint purpose:
         This endpoint is used to merge an available open __version-candidate__, identified by the _versionCandidateId_ parameter, into master version of the registry regulation after the changes have been reviewed. Once the merge operation is completed, the __version-candidate__ will no longer accept any new changes. Successful completion of the merge operation is indicated by a _204 No Content_ response. In case of any conflicts between the __version-candidate__ and the _master version_, such as duplicate names for data elements or changes made to data elements already changed in the _master version_, this API returns a __409 Conflict__ HTTP response. In such cases, the resulting _conflict_ must be resolved before attempting the merge operation again.
